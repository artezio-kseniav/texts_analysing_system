NIST Special Publication 1500-1. NIST Big Data Interoperability  Framework:  Volume 1, Definitions . The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at NIST promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by  providing technical leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops  tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance  the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the  development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the  cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in federal  information systems. This document reports on ITL’s research, guidance, and outreach efforts in  Information Technology and its collaborative activities with industry, government, and academic  organizations. Big Data is a term used to describe the large amountof data in the networked, digitized, sensor-laden,  information-driven world. While opportunities exist with Big Data, the data can overwhelm traditional  technical approaches and the growth of data is outpacing scientific and technological advances in data  analytics. To advance progress in Big Data, the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) is  working to develop consensus on important, fundamentalconcepts related to Big Data. The results are  reported in the NIST Big Data Interoperability Frameworkseries of volumes. This volume, Volume 1,  contains a definition of Big Data and related terms necessary to lay the groundwork for discussions  surrounding Big Data.    The NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) Definitions and Taxonomy Subgroup prepared  this NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework: Volume 1, Definitionsto address fundamental concepts  needed to understand the new paradigm for data applications, collectively known as Big Data, and the  analytic processes collectively known as data science. While Big Data has been defined in a myriad of  ways, the shift to a Big Data paradigm occurs when the scale of the data leads to the need for a cluster of  computing and storage resources to provide cost-effective data management. Data science combines  various technologies, techniques, and theories from various fields, mostly related to computer science and  statistics, to obtain actionable knowledge from data. This report seeks to clarify the underlying concepts  of Big Data and data science to enhance communication among Big Data producers and consumers. By  defining concepts related to Big Data and data science, a common terminology can be used among Big  Data practitioners.  The NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework consists of seven volumes, each of which addresses a  specific key topic, resulting from the work of the NBD-PWG. The seven volumes are as follows:  Definitions,  Taxonomies,  Use Cases and General Requirements,  Security and Privacy, Architectures White Paper Survey, Reference Architecture,  Standards Roadmap. The NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework will be released in three versions, which correspond to  the three development stages of the NBD-PWG work. The three stages aim to achieve the following with  respect to the NIST Big Data Reference Architecture (NBDRA).  There is broad agreement among commercial, academic, and government leaders about the remarkable  potential of Big Data to spark innovation, fuel commerce, and drive progress. Big Data is the common  term used to describe the deluge of data in today’s networked, digitized, sensor-laden, and informationdriven world. The availability of vast data resources carries the potential to answer questions previously  out of reach, including the following:  How can a potential pandemic reliably be detected early enough to intervene, Can new materials with advanced properties be predicted before these materials have ever been  synthesized, How can the current advantage of the attackerover the defender in guarding against cybersecurity threats be reversed. There is also broad agreement on the ability of Big Data to overwhelm traditional approaches. The growth  rates for data volumes, speeds, and complexity are outpacing scientific and technological advances in data  analytics, management, transport, and data user spheres.  Despite widespread agreement on the inherent opportunities and current limitations of Big Data, a lack of  consensus on some important fundamental questions continues to confuse potential users and stymie  progress. These questions include the following:  What attributes define Big Data solutions,  How is Big Data different from traditional dataenvironments and related applications,  What are the essential characteristics of Big Data environments,  How do these environments integrate withcurrently deployed architectures,  What are the central scientific, technological, and standardization challenges that need to be  addressed to accelerate the deployment of robust Big Data solutions,  Within this context, on March 29, 2012, the White House announced the Big Data Research and  Development Initiative. The initiative’s goals include helping to accelerate the pace of discovery in  science and engineering, strengthening national security, and transforming teaching and learning by  improving the ability to extract knowledge and insightsfrom large and complex collections of digital  data.  Six federal departments and their agencies announcedmore than $200 million in commitments spread  across more than 80 projects, which aim to significantly improve the tools and techniques needed to  access, organize, and draw conclusions from huge volumes of digital data. The initiative also challenged  industry, research universities, and nonprofits to join with the federal government to make the most of the  opportunities created by Big Data.  Motivated by the White House initiative and public suggestions, the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) has accepted the challenge to stimulate collaboration among industry professionals to  further the secure and effective adoption of Big Data. As one result of NIST’s Cloud and Big Data Forum  held on January 15–17, 2013, there was strong encouragement for NIST to create a public working group  for the development of a Big Data Standards Roadmap. Forum participants noted that this roadmap  should define and prioritize Big Data requirements, including interoperability, portability, reusability,  extensibility, data usage, analytics, and technology infrastructure. In doing so, the roadmap would  accelerate the adoption of the most secure and effective Big Data techniques and technology.  On June 19, 2013, the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) was launched with extensive  participation by industry, academia, and government from across the nation. The scope of the NBD-PWG  involves forming a community of interests from all sectors—including industry, academia, and  government—with the goal of developing consensus on definitions, taxonomies, secure reference  architectures, security and privacy, and—from these—astandards roadmap. Such a consensus would  create a vendor-neutral, technology- and infrastructure-independent framework that would enable Big  Data stakeholders to identify and use the best analytics tools for their processing and visualization  requirements on the most suitable computing platform and cluster, while also allowing value-added from  Big Data service providers.  This volume was prepared by the NBD-PWG Definitions and Taxonomy Subgroup, which focused on  identifying Big Data concepts and defining related terms in areas such as data science, reference  architecture, and patterns.  The aim of this volume is to provide a common vocabulary for those involved with Big Data. For  managers, the terms in this volume will distinguish the concepts needed to understand this changing field.  For procurement officers, this document will providethe framework for discussing organizational needs  and distinguishing among offered approaches. For marketers, this document will provide the means to  promote solutions and innovations. For the technical community, this volume will provide a common  language to better differentiate the specific offerings.  Big Dataand data scienceare being used as buzzwords and are composites of many concepts. To better  identify those terms, the NBD-PWG Definitions and Taxonomy Subgroup first addressed the individual  concepts needed in this disruptive field. Then, the two over-arching buzzwordsBig Data and data  scienceand the concepts they encompass were clarified. To keep the topic of data and data systems manageable, the Subgroup attempted to limit discussions to  differences affected by the existence of Big Data. Expansive topics such as data type or analytics  taxonomies and metadata were only explored to the extentthat there were issues or effects specific to Big  Data. However, the Subgroup did include the concepts involved in other topics that are needed to  understand the new Big Data methodologies.  Terms were developed independent of a specific toolor implementation, to avoid highlighting specific  implementations, and to stay general enough for the inevitable changes in the field.  The Subgroup is aware that some fields, such as legal, use specific language that may differ from the  definitions provided herein. The current version reflects the breadth of knowledge of the Subgroup  members. During the comment period, the broader community is requested to address any domain  conflicts caused by the terminology used in this volume.  This volume seeks to clarify the meanings of the broad terms Big Data and data science, which are  discussed at length in Section 2. The more elemental concepts and terms that provide additional insights  are discussed in Section 3. Section 4 explores several concepts that are more detailed. This first version of  NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework: Volume 1, Definitionsdescribes some of the fundamental  concepts that will be important to determine categories or functional capabilities that represent  architecture choices.  Tightly coupled information can be found in the other volumes of the NIST Big Data Interoperability  Framework. Volume 2, Taxonomiesprovides a description of the more detailed components of the NIST  Big Data Reference Architecture (NBDRA) presented in Volume 6, Reference Architecture. Security- and  privacy-related concepts are described in detail in Volume 4, Security and Privacy. To understand how  these systems are architected to meet users’ needs, the reader is referred to Volume 3, Use Cases and  General Requirements. Volume 7, Standards Roadmaprecaps the framework established in Volumes 1  through 6 and discusses NBDRA-related standards. Comparing related sections in these volumes will  provide a more comprehensive understanding of the consensus of the NBD-PWG. This volume represents the beginning stage of the NBD-PWG’s effort to provide order and clarity to an  emerging and rapidly changing field. Big Data encompasses a large range of data types, fields of study,  technologies, and techniques. Distilling from the varied viewpoints a consistent core set of definitions to  frame the discussion has been challenging. However,through discussion of the varied viewpoints, a  greater understanding of the Big Data paradigm will emerge. As the field matures, this document will also  need to mature to accommodate innovations in the field. To ensure that the concepts are accurate, future  NBD-PWG tasks will consist of the following:  Defining the different patterns of communicationsbetween Big Data resources to better clarify  the different approaches being taken,  Updating Volume 1 taking into account the efforts of other working groups such as International  Organization for Standardization (ISO) Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) and the Transaction  Processing Performance Council,  Improving the discussions of governance and data ownership,  Developing the Management section,  Developing the Security and Privacy section, and  Adding a discussion of the value of data. The rate of growth of data generated and stored has been increasing exponentially. In a 1965 paper, 2  Gordon Moore estimated that the density of transistors on an integrated circuit board was doubling every  two years. Known as “Moore’s Law,” this rate of growth has been applied to all aspects of computing,  from clock speeds to memory. The growth rates of datavolumes are considered faster than Moore’s Law,  with data volumes more than doubling every eighteen months. This data explosion is creating  opportunities for new ways of combining and using data to find value, as well as providing significant  challenges due to the size of the data being managed and analyzed. One significant shift is in the amount  of unstructured data. Historically, structured data has typically been the focus of most enterprise analytics,  and has been handled through the use of the relational data model. Recently, the quantity of unstructured  data, such as micro-texts, web pages, relationship data, images and videos, has exploded, and the trend  indicates an increase in the incorporation of unstructured data to generate value. The central benefit of  Big Data analytics is the ability to process large amounts and various types of information. Big Data does  not imply that the current data volumes are simply “bigger” than before, or bigger than current techniques  can efficiently handle. The need for greater performance or efficiency happens on a continual basis.  However, Big Data represents a fundamental changein the architecture needed to efficiently handle  current datasets.  In the evolution of data systems, there have been a number of times when the need for efficient, costeffective data analysis has forced a change in existing technologies. For example, the move to a relational  model occurred when methods to reliably handle changes to structured data led to the shift toward a data  storage paradigm that modeled relational algebra. That was a fundamental shift in data handling. The  current revolution in technologies referred to as Big Data has arisen because the relational data model can  no longer efficiently handle all the current needs for analysis of large and often unstructured datasets. It is  not just that data is bigger than before, as it has been steadily getting larger for decades. The Big Data  revolution is instead a one-time fundamental shift in architecture, just as the shift to the relational model  was a one-time shift. As relational databases evolved to greater efficiencies over decades, so too will Big  Data technologies continue to evolve. Many of the conceptual underpinnings of Big Data have been  around for years, but the last decade has seen an explosion in their maturation and application to scaled  data systems.  The term Big Data has been used to describe a number of concepts, in part because several distinct  aspects are consistently interacting with each other. To understand this revolution, the interplay of the  following four aspects must be considered: the characteristics of the datasets, the analysis of the datasets,  the performance of the systems that handle the data, and the business considerations of cost-effectiveness.  In the following sections, the two broad concepts, Big Data and data science, are broken down into  specific individual terms and concepts. Big Data refers to the inability of traditional data architectures to efficiently handle the new datasets.  Characteristics of Big Data that force new architectures are:  Volume(i.e., the size of the dataset),  Variety(i.e., data from multiple repositories, domains, or types),  Velocity(i.e., rate of flow), and  Variability(i.e., the change in other characteristics).  These characteristics—volume, variety, velocity, and variability—are known colloquially as the ‘Vs’ of  Big Data and are further discussed in Section 3. While many other V’s have been attributed to Big Data,  only the above four drive the shift to new parallel architectures for data-intensive applications, in order to  achieve cost-effective performance. These Big Data characteristics dictate the overall design of a Big  Data system, resulting in different data system architectures or different data life cycle process orderings  to achieve needed efficiencies.  Big Data consists of extensive datasetsprimarily in the characteristics of volume,  variety, velocity, and/or variabilitythat require a scalable architecture for efficient  storage, manipulation, and analysis.  Note that this definition contains the interplay between the characteristics of the data and the need for a  system architecture that can scale to achieve the needed performance and cost efficiency. There are two  fundamentally different methods for system scaling, often described metaphorically as “vertical” or  “horizontal” scaling. Vertical scalingimplies increasing the system parameters of processing speed,  storage, and memory for greater performance. This approach is limited by physical capabilities whose  improvements have been described by Moore’s Law, requiring ever more sophisticated elements (e.g.,  hardware, software) that add time and expense to the implementation. The alternate method is to use  horizontal scaling, to make use of distributed individual resources integrated to act as a single system. It  is this horizontal scaling that is at the heart of the Big Data revolution.  The Big Data paradigm consists of the distribution of data systems across horizontally  coupled, independent resources to achieve the scalability needed for the efficient  processing of extensive datasets.  This new paradigm leads to a number of conceptual definitions that suggest Big Data exists when the  scale of the data causes the management of the data to be a significant driver in the design of the system  architecture. This definition does notexplicitly refer to the horizontal scaling in the Big Data paradigm.  As stated above, fundamentally, the Big Data paradigm is a shift in data system architectures from  monolithic systems with vertical scaling (i.e., adding more power, such as faster processors or disks, to  existing machines) into a parallelized, “horizontally scaled”, system (i.e., adding more machines to the  available collection) that uses a loosely coupled set ofresources in parallel. This type of parallelization  shift began over 20 years ago for compute-intensive applications in simulation communities, when  scientific simulations began using massively parallel processing (MPP) systems.  Massively parallel processingrefers to a multitude of individual processors working in  parallel to execute a particular program.  In different combinations of splitting the code and data across independent processors, computational  scientists were able to greatly extend their simulation capabilities. This, of course, introduced a number of  complications in such areas as message passing, data movement, latency in the consistency across  resources, load balancing, and system inefficiencies,while waiting on other resources to complete their  computational tasks.  The Big Data paradigm, likewise, is undergoing the shift to parallelism for data-intensive applications.  Data systems need a level of extensibility that matches the scaling in the data. To get that level of  extensibility, different mechanisms are needed to distribute data and for data retrieval processes across  loosely coupled resources.  One main issue is when a problem is considered within the realm of Big Data. Developing universal  criteria for the determination is difficult since the choice to use the parallel Big Data architecture is based  on the interplay of performance and cost. Designation of a problem as a Big Data problem depends on a  business analysis of the application’s requirements. This issue is an ongoing topic of discussion in the  NBD-PWG to see what guidance can be provided in this area.  While the methods to achieve efficient scalability across resources will continually evolve, this paradigm  shift (in analogy to the prior shift in the simulation community) is a one-time occurrence. Eventually, a  new paradigm shift will likely occur beyond this distribution of a processing or data system that spans  multiple resources working in parallel. That futurerevolution will need to be described with new  terminology.  Big Data focuses on the self-referencing viewpoint that data is big because it requires scalable systems to  handle it. Conversely, architectures with better scaling have come about because of the need to handle Big  Data. It is difficult to delineate a size requirement for a dataset to be considered Big Data. Data is usually  considered “big” if the use of new scalable architectures provides a cost or performance efficiency over  the traditional vertically scaled architectures (i.e., if similar performance cannot be achieved in a  traditional, single platform computing resource.) This circular relationship between the characteristics of  the data and the performance of data systems leads to different definitions for Big Data if only one aspect  is considered.  Some definitions for Big Data focus on the systems innovations required because of the characteristics of  Big Data.  Big Data engineeringincludes advanced techniques that harness independent resources  for building scalable data systems when the characteristics of the datasets require new  architectures for efficient storage, manipulation, and analysis.  Once again the definition is coupled, so that Big Dataengineering is used when the volume, velocity,  variety, or variability characteristics of the data require it. New engineering techniques in the data layer  have been driven by the growing prominence of datasets that cannot be handled efficiently in a traditional  relational model. The need for scalableaccess in structured data has led to software built on the key-value  pair paradigm. The rise in importance of document analysis has spawned a document-oriented database  paradigm, and the increasing importance of relationship data has led to efficiencies in the use of graphoriented data storage.  The new non-relational model database paradigms are typically referred to as NoSQL(Not Only or No  Structured Query Language [SQL]) systems, which are further discussed in Section 3. The problem with  identifying Big Data storage paradigms as NoSQL is, first, that it describes the storage of data with  respect to a set theory-based language for query and retrieval of data, and second, that there is a growing  capability in the application of the SQL query language against the new non-relational data repositories.  While NoSQL is in such common usage that it will continue to refer to the new data models beyond the  relational model, it is hoped that the term itself will be replaced with a more suitable term, since it is  unwise to name a set of new storage paradigms with respect to a query language currently in use against  that storage.  Non-relational models, frequently referred to as NoSQL, refer to logical data models  that do not follow relational algebra for the storage and manipulation of data.  Note that for systems and analysis processes, the Big Data paradigm shift also causes changes in the  traditional data life cycle processes. One description of the end-to-end data life cycle categorizes the  process steps as collection, preparation, analysis, and action. Different Big Data use cases can be  characterized in terms of the dataset characteristics and in terms of the time window for the end-to-end  data life cycle. Dataset characteristics change the data life cycle processes in different ways, for example  in the point in the life cycle at which the data is placed in persistent storage. In a traditional relational  model, the data is stored after preparation (e.g., after the extract-transform-load and cleansing processes).  In a volume use case, the data is often stored in the raw state in which it was produced—before being  cleansed and organized (sometimes referred to as extract-load-transform). The consequence of persistence  of data in its raw state is that a schema or model for the data is only applied whenthe data is retrieved for  preparation and analysis. This Big Dataconcept is described as schema-on-read. Schema-on-readis the application of a data schema through preparation steps such as  transformations, cleansing, and integration at the time the data is read from the  database.  In a high-velocity application, the data is prepared and analyzed for alerting, and only then is the data (or  aggregates of the data) given a persistent storage.  Another concept of Big Data is often referred to as moving the processing to the data, not the data to the  processing.  Computational portability is the movement of the computation to the location of the data.  The implication is that data is too extensive to be queried and moved into another resource for analysis, so  the analysis program is instead distributed to the data-holding resources, with only the results being  aggregated on a remote resource. This concept of data locality is actually a critical aspect of parallel data  architectures. Additional system concepts are the interoperability (ability for tools to work together),  reusability (ability to apply tools from one domain to another), and extendibility (ability to add or modify  existing tools for new domains). These system concepts are not specific to Big Data, but their presence in  Big Data can be understood in the examination of a Big Data reference architecture, which is discussed in  NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework: Volume 6, Reference Architecture of this series.  Additional concepts used in reference to the term Big Data refer to changes in analytics, which will be  discussed in Section 2.2. A number of other terms (particularly terms starting with the letter V) are also  used, several of which refer to the data science process or its benefit, instead of new Big Data  characteristics. Some of these additional terms include veracity(i.e., accuracy of the data), value(i.e.,  value of the analytics to the organization), volatility(i.e., tendency for data structures to change over  time), and validity(i.e., appropriateness of the data for its intended use). While these characteristics and  othersincluding quality control, metadata, and data provenancelong predated Big Data, their impact  is still important in Big Data systems. Several ofthese terms are discussed with respect to Big Data  analytics in Section 3.4.  Essentially, Big Data refers to the extensibility of data repositories and data processing across resources  working in parallel, in the same way that the compute-intensive simulation community embraced  massively parallel processing two decades ago. Byworking out methods for communication among  resources, the same scaling is now available to data-intensive applications.  In its purest form, data science is the fourth paradigmof science, following experiment, theory, and  computational sciences. The fourth paradigm is a term coined by Dr. Jim Gray in 2007. 3 Data-intensive  science, shortened to data science, refers to the conduct of data analysis as an empirical science, learning  directly from data itself. This can take the form of collecting data followed by open-ended analysis  without preconceived hypothesis (sometimes referred to as discovery or data exploration). The second  empirical method refers to the formulation of a hypothesis, the collection of the data—new or  preexisting—to address the hypothesis, and the analytical confirmation or denial of the hypothesis (or the  determination that additional information or study is needed.) In both methods, the conclusions are based  on the data. In many data science projects, the raw data is browsed first, which informs a hypothesis,  which is then investigated. As in any experimental science, the end result could be that the original  hypothesis itself needs to be reformulated. The key concept is that data science is an empirical science,  performing the scientific process directly on the data. Note that the hypothesis may be driven by a  business need, or can be the restatement of a business need in terms of a technical hypothesis.  Data science is the extraction of actionable knowledge directly from data through a  process of discovery, or hypothesis formulation and hypothesis testing.  Data science can be understood as the activities happening in the processing layer of the system  architecture, against data stored in the data layer,in order to extract knowledge from the raw data.  The term analyticsrefers to the discovery of meaningful patterns in data, and is one of the steps in the  data life cycle of collection of raw data, preparation of information, analysis of patterns to synthesize  knowledge, and action to produce value.  The data life cycleis the set of processes in an application that transform raw data into  actionable knowledge.  Analytics is used to refer to the methods, their implementations in tools, and the results of the use of the  tools as interpreted by the practitioner.  Theanalyticsprocess is the synthesis of knowledge from information.  Analytic methods were classically developed for simple data tables. When storage became expensive,  relational databases and methods weredeveloped. With the advent of less expensive storage and Big  Data, new strategies to cope with the volume don’tnecessarily require the use of relational methods.  These new strategies for Big Data Engineering involverearrangement of the data, parallel storage,  parallel processing, and revisions to algorithms. With the new Big Data paradigm, analytics  implementations can no longer be designed independent of the data storage design, as could be previously  assumed if the data was already cleansed and stored in a relational model. Analytics implementations  must now be designed at the same time that the datadistribution is being designed for storage. For large  volumes, the data cleansing, preparation, and analytics are implemented as a single process. Performing  the data organization when the data is queried for analytics is defined above as schema-on-read. Analytics  refers to a specific process in the life cycle, whereas data-intensive science involves all steps in the life  cycle.  Data science across the entire data life cycle incorporates principles, techniques, and methods from many  disciplines and domains including data cleansing, data management, analytics, visualization, engineering,  and in the context of Big Data, now also includes Big Data Engineering.  Data science applicationsimplement data transformation processes from the data life  cycle in the context of Big Data Engineering.  Data scientists and data science teams solve complex data problems by employing deep expertise in one  or more of these disciplines, in the context of business strategy, and under the guidance of domain  knowledge. Personal skills in communication, presentation, and inquisitiveness are also very important  given the complexity of interactions within Big Data systems.  A data scientistis a practitioner who has sufficient knowledge in the overlapping regimes  of business needs, domain knowledge, analytical skills, and software and systems  engineering to manage the end-to-end dataprocesses in the data life cycle.  While this full collection of skills can be present in a single individual, it is also possible that these skills,  as shown in Figure 1, are covered in the members ofa team. A Venn diagram is often shown to describe  the overlapping skills needed for data science. In the early days of experiments, experts in a particular  domain would perform the data analysis. With the advent of computers for analysis, additional skills in  statistics or machine learning were needed for more sophisticated analysis, or domain experts would work  with software and system engineers to build customized analytical applications. With the increase in  complexity of compute-intensive simulations across parallel processors, computational science techniques  were needed to implement the algorithms on these architectures. For data-intensive applications, all of  these skill groups are needed to distribute both the data and the computation across systems of resources  working in parallel. While data scientists seldom have strong skills in all these areas, they need to have an  understanding of all areas to deliver value from data-intensive applications and work in a team that spans  all of these areas. Data science is not solely concerned with analytics, but also with the end-to-end life cycle, where the data  system is essentially the scientific equipment being used to develop an understanding of a real-world  process. The implication is that the data scientist must be aware of the sources and provenance of the data,  the appropriateness and accuracy of the transformations on the data, the interplay between the  transformation algorithms and processes, and the data storage mechanisms. This end-to-end overview role  ensures that everything is performed correctly toexplore the data and create and validate hypotheses.  Data science is increasingly used to influence business decisions. These analytics concepts are discussed  further in Section 3.4.  Several issues are currently being debated within the data sciencecommunity. Two prominent examples  are data sampling, and the idea that more data is superior to better algorithms.  Data sampling, a central concept of statistics, involves the selection of a subset of data from the larger  data population. Provided that the subset is adequately representative of the larger population, the subset  of data can be used to explore the appropriateness of the data population for specific hypothesis tests or  questions. For example, it is possible to calculate the data needed to determine an outcome for an  experimental procedure (e.g., during a pharmaceutical clinical trial).  When the data mining community began, the emphasis was typically on repurposed data (i.e., data used to  train models was sampled from a larger dataset thatwas originally collected for another purpose). The  often-overlooked critical step was to ensure that the analytics were not prone to over-fitting (i.e., the  analytical pattern matched the data sample but did not work well to answer questions of the overall data  population). In the new Big Data paradigm, it is implied that data sampling from the overall data  population is no longer necessary since the Big Data system can theoretically process all the data without  loss of performance. However, even if all of the available data is used, it still may only represent a  population subset whose behaviors led them to produce the data, which might not be the true population  of interest. For example, studying Twitter data to analyze people’s behaviors does not represent all  people, as not everyone uses Twitter. While less sampling may be used in data science processes, it is  important to be aware of the implicit data sampling when trying to address business questions. analyzing larger samples of data rather that refining the algorithms used in the analytics. The heart of this  debate states that a few bad data elements are less likely to influence the analytical results in a large  dataset than if errors are present in a small sample of that dataset. If the analytics needs are correlation  and not causation, then this assertion is easier to justify. Outside the context of large datasets in which  aggregate trending behavior is all that matters, the data quality rule remains “garbage-in, garbage-out,”  where you cannot expect accurate results based on inaccurate data.  Data science is tightly linked to Big Data, and refers to the management and execution of the end-to-end  data processes, including the behaviors of the data system. As such, data science includes all of analytics,  but analytics does not include all of data science.        Individual data elements have not changed with Big Data and are not discussed in detail in this document.  For additional information on data types, readers are directed to the ISO standard ISO/IEC 11404:2007  General Purpose Datatypes, and, as an example, its extension intohealthcare information data types in  ISO 21090:2011 Health Informatics. One important concept to Big Data is metadata, which is often described as “data about data.” Metadata  describes additional information about the data such as how and when data was collected and how it has  been processed. Metadata should itself be viewed as data with all the requirements for tracking, change  management, and security. Many standards are being developed for metadata, for general metadata  coverage (e.g., ISO/IEC 11179-x) and discipline-specific metadata (e.g., ISO 19115-x for geospatial  data).  Metadata that describes the history of a dataset is called its provenance, which is discussed in Section 3.5.  As open data(data available to others) and linked data(data that is connected to other data) become the  norm, it is increasingly important to have information about how data was collected, transmitted, and  processed. Provenance type of metadata guides users to correct data utilization when the data is  repurposed from its original collection process in an effort to extract additional value.  Semantic metadata, another type of metadata, refers to the description of a data element to assist with  proper interpretation. An ontologycan be conceptualized as a graphic model, representing a semantic  relationship between entities. Ontologies are semantic models constrained to follow different levels of  logic models. Ontologies and semantic models predated Big Data and are not discussed in depth this  document. Ontologies can be very general or extremely domain-specific in nature. A number of  mechanisms exist for implementing these unique descriptions, and the reader is referred to the World  Wide Web Consortium (W3C) efforts on the semantic web for additional information. Semantic data  is important in the new Big Data Paradigm since the Semantic Web represents a Big Data attempt to  provide cross-cutting meanings for terms. Again, semantic metadata is especially important for linked  data efforts.  Taxonomiesrepresent in some sense metadata about data element relationships. Taxonomy is a  hierarchical relationship between entities, where a data element is broken down into smaller component  parts. While these concepts are important, theypredated the Big Data paradigm shift.  Data elements are collected into records that describe a particular observation, event, or transaction.  Previously, most of the data in business systems was structured data, where each record was consistently  structured and could be described efficiently in a relational model. Records are conceptualized as the  rows in a table where data elements are in the cells. Unstructured data types, such as text, image, video,  and relationship data, have been increasing in both volume and prominence. While modern relational  databases tend to have support for these types of data elements, their ability to directly analyze, index, and  process them has tended to be both limited and accessedvia nonstandard SQL extensions. The need to  analyze unstructuredor semi-structureddata has been present for many years. However, the Big Data  paradigm shift has increased the emphasis on extracting the value from unstructured or relationship data,  and also on different engineering methods that can handle data more efficiently.  Big Data Engineering refers to the new ways that data is stored in records. In some cases, the records are  still in the concept of a table structure. One storage paradigm is a key-value structure, with a record  consisting of a key and a string of data together in the value. The data is retrieved through the key, and the  non-relational database software handles accessing the data in the value. This can be viewed as a  subset/simplification of a relational database table with a single index field and column. A variant on this  is the document store, where the document has multiplevalue fields, any of which can be used as the  index/key. The difference from the relational table model is that the set of documents do not need to have  all the same value fields.  Another type of new Big Data record storage is in a graphical model. A graphical model represents the  relationship between data elements. The data elements are nodes, and the relationship is represented as a  link between nodes. Graph storage models represent each data element as a series of subject, predicate,  and object triples. Often, the available types of objects and relationships are described via ontologies as  discussed above.  Another data element relationship concept that is not new in the Big Data paradigm shift is the presence  of complexitybetween the data elements. There are systems where data elements cannot be analyzed  outside the context of other data elements. This is evident, for example, in the analytics for the Human  Genome Project, where it is the relationship between the elements and their position and proximity to  other elements that matters. The term complexityis often attributed to Big Data, but it refers to this  interrelationship between data elements or across data records, independent of whether the dataset has the  characteristics of Big Data. Data records are grouped into datasets, which can havethe Big Data characteristics of volume, velocity,  variety, and variability. Dataset characteristics can refer to the data itself, or data at rest, while  characteristics of the data that is traversing a network or temporarily residing in computer memory to be  read or updated is referred to as data in motion, which is discussed in Section 3.4.  Typical characteristics of data at rest that are notably different in the era of Big Data are volume and  variety. Volume is the characteristic of data at rest that is most associated with Big Data. Estimates show  that the amount of data in the world doubles every two years. 19 Should this trend continue, by 2020 there  would be 500 times the amount of data as existed in 2011. The data volumes have stimulated new ways  for scalable storage across a collection of horizontallycoupled resources, as described in Section 2.1.  The second characteristic of data at rest is the increasing need to use a variety of data, meaning the data  represents a number of data domains and a number of data types. Traditionally, a variety of data was  handled through transformations or pre-analytics to extract features that would allow integration with  other data. The wider range of data formats, logical models, timescales, and semantics, which is desirous  to use in analytics, complicates the integration of the variety of data. For example, data to be integrated  could be text from social networks, image data, or a raw feed directly from a sensor source. To deal with  a wider range of data formats, a federated database model was designed as a database across the  underlying databases. Data to be integrated for analytics could now be of such volume that it cannot be  moved to integrate, or it may be that some of the data is not under control of the organization creating the  data system. In either case, the variety of Big Data forces a range of new Big Data engineering solutions  to efficiently and automatically integrate data thatis stored across multiple repositories, in multiple  formats, and in multiple logical data models.  Big Data engineering has spawned data storage models that are more efficient for unstructured data than  the traditional relational model, causing a derivative issue for the mechanisms to integrate this data. New  scalable techniques have arisen to manage and manipulate Big Data not stored in traditional expensive  high-performance “vertically” scaled systems, but rather spread across a number of less expensive  resources. For example, the document store was developed specifically to support the idea of storing and  indexing heterogeneous data in a common repository for analysis. New types of non-relational storage for  data records are discussed below.  Shared-disk File Systems:These approaches, such as Storage Area Networks (SANs) and Network  Attached Storage (NAS),use a single storage pool, which is accessed from multiple computing resources.  While these technologies solved many aspects of accessing very large datasets from multiple nodes  simultaneously, they suffered from issues related to data locking and updates and, more importantly,  created a performance bottleneck (from every input/output [I/O] operation accessing the common storage  pool) that limited their ability to scale up to meetthe needs of many Big Data applications. These  limitations were overcome through the implementation of fullydistributed file systems.  Distributed File Systems: In distributed file storage systems, multi-structured (object) datasets are  distributed across the computing nodes of the server cluster(s). The data may be distributed at the  file/dataset level, or more commonly, at the block level, allowing multiple nodes in the cluster to interact  with different parts of a large file/dataset simultaneously. Big Data frameworks are frequently designed to  take advantage of data locality toeach node when distributing the processing, which avoids any need to  move the data between nodes. In addition, many distributed file systems also implement file/block level  replication where each file/block is stored multiple times on different machines for both  reliability/recovery (data is not lost if a node in the cluster fails), as well as enhanced data locality. Any  type of data and many sizes of files can be handled without formal extract, transformation, and load  conversions, with some technologies performing markedly better for large file sizes.  Distributed Computing:The popular framework for distributed computing consists of a storage layer and  processing layer combination that implements a multiple-class, algorithm-programming model. Low-cost  servers supporting the distributed file system that stores the data can dramatically lower the storage costs  of computing on a large scale of data (e.g., web indexing). Map/Reduceis the default processing  component in data-distributed computing where the query is scattered across the processors and the  results are gathered into a central processor. Processing results are typically then loaded into an analysis  environment. Map/Reduce is discussed further in Volume 6.  The use of inexpensive servers is appropriate for slower, batch-speed Big Data applications, but do not  provide good performance for applications requiring low latency processing. The use of basic  Map/Reduce for processing places limitations on updating or iterative access to the data during  computation. Bulk Synchronous Parallelism systems or newer Map/Reduce developments can be used  when repeated updating is a requirement. Improvements and “generalizations” of Map/Reduce have been  developed that provide additional functions lacking in the older technology, including fault tolerance,  iteration flexibility, elimination of middle layer, and ease of query.  Resource Negotiation:The common distributed computing systemhas little in the way of built-in data  management capabilities. In response, several technologies have been developed to provide the necessary  support functions, including operations management, workflow integration, security, and governance. Of  special importance to resource management development are new features for supporting additional  processing models (other than Map/Reduce) and controls for multi-tenant environments, higher  availability, and lower latency applications.  In a typical implementation, the resource manager is the hub for several node managers. The client or user  accesses the resource manager which in turn launches a request to an application master within one or  many node managers. A second client may also launch its own requests, which will be given to other  application masters within the same or other node managers. Tasks are assigned a priority value allocated  based on available CPU and memory, and provided the appropriate processing resource in the node.  Data movement is normally handled by transfer and application program interface (API) technologies  other than the resource manager. In rare cases, peer-to-peer (P2P) communications protocols can also  propagate or migrate files across networks at scale, meaning that technically these P2P networks are also  distributed file systems. The largest social networks, arguably some of the most dominant users of Big  Data, move binary large objects (BLOBs) of over 1 gigabyte (GB) in size internally over large numbers of  computers via such technologies. The internal use case has been extended to private file synchronization,  where the technology permits automatic updates to local folders whenever two end users are linked  through the system.  In external use cases, each end of the P2P systemcontributes bandwidth to the data movement, making  this currently the fastest way to leverage documents to the largest number of concurrent users. For  example, this technology is used to make 3GB images available to the public, or to allow general purpose  home computers to devote compute power for scientific challenges such as protein folding. However, any  large bundle of data (e.g., video, scientific data) can be quickly distributed with lower bandwidth cost.  There are additional aspects of Big Data that are changing rapidly and are not fully explored in this  document, including cluster management and other mechanisms for providing communication among the  cluster resources holding the data in the non-relational models. Discussion of the use of multiple tiers of  storage (e.g., in-memory, cache, solid state drive, hard drive, network drive) in the newly emerging  software-defined storage can be found in other industry publications. Software-defined storage is the use  of software to determine the dynamic allocation oftiers of storage to reduce storage costs while  maintaining the required data retrieval performance.  Analytic processes are often characterized as discoveryfor the initial hypothesis formulation,  development for establishing the analytics process for a specific hypothesis, and appliedfor the  encapsulation of the analysis into an operational system. While Big Data has touched all three types of  analytic processes, the majority ofthe changes is observed in development and applied analytics. New  Big Data engineering technologies change the types of analytics that are possible, but do not result in  completely new types of analytics. However, given the retrieval speeds, analysts are able to interact with  their data in ways that were not previously possible. Traditional statistical analytic techniques downsize,  sample, or summarize the data before analysis. This was done to make analysis of large datasets  reasonable on hardware that could not scale to the size of the dataset. Big Data analytics often emphasize  the value of computation across the entire dataset, which gives analysts better chances to determine  causation, rather than just correlation. Correlation, though, is still useful when knowing the direction or  trend of something is enough to take action. Today, most analytics in statistics and data mining focus on  causation—being able to describe why something ishappening. Discovering the cause aids actors in  changing a trend or outcome. Actors, which in system development can represent individuals,  organizations, software, or hardware, are discussed in NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework:  Volume 2, Taxonomy. Big Data solutions make it more feasible to implement causation type of complex  analytics for large, complex, and heterogeneous data.  In addition to volume, velocity, variety, and variability, several terms, many beginning with V, have been  used in connection with Big Data requirements for the system architecture. Some of these terms strongly  relate to analytics on the data. Veracity and provenance are two such terms and are discussed below.  Veracity refers to the completeness and accuracy of the data and relates to the vernacular “garbage-in,  garbage-out” description for data quality issues in existence for a long time. If the analytics are causal,  then the quality of every data element is extremely important. If the analytics are correlations or trending  over massive volume datasets, then individual bad elements could be lost in the overall counts and the  trend will still be accurate. As mentioned in Section 2.2, many people debatewhether “more data is  superior to better algorithms,” but that is a topic better discussed elsewhere.  As discussed in Section 3.1, the provenance, or history of the data, is increasingly an essential factor in  Big Data analytics, as more and more data is being repurposed for new types of analytics in completely  different disciplines from which the data was created. Asthe usage of data persists far beyond the control  of the data producers, it becomes ever more essential that metadata about the full creation and processing  history is made available along with the data. In addition, it is vital to know what analytics may have  produced the data, since there are always confidence ranges, error ranges, and precision/recall limits  associated with analytic outputs.  Another analytics consideration is the speed of interaction between the analytics processes and the person  or process responsible for delivering the actionable insight. Analytic data processing speed can fall along  a continuum between batch and streaming-oriented processing. Although the processing continuum  existed prior to the era of Big Data, the desired location on this continuum is a large factor in the choice  of architectures and component tools to be used. Given the greater query and analytic speeds within Big  Data due to the scaling across a cluster, there is an increasing emphasis on interactive (i.e., real-time)  processing. Rapid analytics cycles allow an analyst to do exploratory discoveryon the data, browsing  more of the data space than might otherwise have been possible in any practical time frame. The  processing continuum is further discussed in NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework: Volume 6,  Reference Architecture.  Initial considerations in the use ofBig Data engineering include the determination, for a particular  situation, of the size threshold after which data should be considered Big Data. Multiple factors must be  considered in this determination, and the outcome isparticular to each application. As described in  Section 2.1, Big Data characteristics lead to use of Big Data engineering techniques that allow the data  system to operate affordably and efficiently. Whether a performance or cost efficiency can be attained for  a particular application requires a design analysis, which is beyond the scope of this report.  There is a significant need for metrics and benchmarking to provide standards for the performance of Big  Data systems. While there are a number of standard metrics used in benchmarking, only the ones relevant  to the new Big Data Paradigm would be within the scope of this work. This topic is being addressed by  the Transaction Processing Performance Council TCP-xHD Big Data Committee, and available  information from their efforts may be included in future versions of this report. The definition of data governance includes managementacross the complete data life cycle, whether the  data is at rest, in motion, in incomplete stages, or transactions. To maximize its benefit, data governance  must also consider the issues of privacy and security of individuals of all ages, individuals as companies,  and companies as companies.  Data governance is needed to address important issues in the new global Internet Big Data economy. For  example, many businesses provide a data hosting platform for data that is generated by the users of the  system. While governance policies and processes from the point of view of the data hosting company are  commonplace, the issue of governance and control rightsof the data providers is new. Many questions  remain including the following: Do they still own their data, or is the data owned by the hosting  company? Do the data producers have the ability to delete their data? Can they control who is allowed to  see their data?  The question of governance resides between the value that one party (e.g., the data hosting company)  wants to generate versus the rights that the data provider wants to retain to obtain their own value. New  governance concerns arising from the Big Data Paradigm need greater discussion, and will be discussed  during the development of the next version of this document. Theanalyticsis the synthesis of knowledge from information.  Big Data consists of extensive datasetsprimarily in the characteristics of volume, variety, velocity,  and/or variabilitythat require a scalable architecture for efficient storage, manipulation, and analysis.  Big Data engineering includes advanced techniques that harness independent resources for building  scalable data systems when the characteristics of the datasets require new architectures for efficient  storage, manipulation, and analysis.  The Big Data paradigm consists of the distribution of data systems across horizontally coupled,  independent resources to achieve the scalability needed for the efficient processing of extensive  datasets.  Computational portability is the movement of the computation to the location of the data.  Data governance refers to the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and  security of the data employed in an enterprise.  The data lifecycleis the set of processes that transformsraw data into actionable knowledge, which  includes data collection, preparation, analytics, visualization, and access.  Data science is the empirical synthesis of actionable knowledge from raw data through the complete data  life cycle process.
