Information Technology – Big Data – Overview and Vocabulary (Updates 	after July WG9 F2F Meeting in Spain). ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization. The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are described in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular the different approval criteria needed for the different types of ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the editorial rules of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. Details of any patent rights identified during the development of the document will be in the Introduction and/or on the ISO list of patent declarations received. Any trade name used in this document is information given for the convenience of users and does not constitute an endorsement.

The Big Data paradigm is a rapidly changing field with rapidly changing technologies. This standard will provide the normative definitions and the vocabulary needed to promote improved communication and understanding of this emerging area. The ISO/IEC JTC1 WG9 on Big data decided that the normative content of this document would benefit greatly at this time with another informative document that provided context for the creation of 20546, as well as discussion of the concepts ascribed to Big Data that are not in fact new to Big Data. The technical report will provide the conceptual overview of the emerging field of Big Data, its relationship to other technical areas and standards efforts, and the concepts ascribed to big data that are not new to Big Data. The technical report is expected to be time sensitive and will need revision over time. This International Standard provides an overview of Big Data along with a set of terms and definitions. It provides a terminological foundation for Big Data-related standards. The following documents, in whole or in part, are normatively referenced in this document and are indispensable for its application. For dated references, only the edition cited applies. For undated references, the latest edition of the referenced document (including any amendments) applies. The term Big Data implies data that is extensive in volume, velocity, or variety. The term does not, however, represent data that is simply bigger than before, since this has happened on a regular basis for decades. The specific occurrence that has led to the widespread usage of this term is that these extensive datasets can no longer be handled in traditional data system architectures. The term big data implies the paradigm shift to use distributed, scalable computing for data-intensive systems to achieve the needed performance efficiency at an affordable cost. In the evolution of data systems, there have been a number of times when the need for efficient, cost effective data analysis has forced a change in existing technologies. For example, the move to a relational model occurred when methods to reliably handle changes to structured data led to the shift toward a data storage paradigm that modelled relational algebra. That was a fundamental shift in data handling. The current revolution in technologies referred to as Big Data has arisen because the relational data model can no longer efficiently handle all the current needs for analysis of large and often unstructured datasets. It is not just that data is bigger than before, as it has been steadily getting larger for decades. The Big Data revolution is instead a one-time fundamental shift in architecture, just as the shift to the relational model was a one-time shift. As relational databases evolved to greater efficiencies over decades, so too will Big Data technologies continue to evolve. Many of the conceptual underpinnings of Big Data have been around for years, but the last decade has seen an explosion in their maturation and application to scaled data systems. The term Big Data is overloaded in common usage, and is commonly used to represent a number of related concepts, in part because several distinct dimensions are consistently interacting with each other. To understand this revolution, the interplay of the following aspects must be considered: the characteristics of the datasets, the analysis of the datasets, the performance of the systems that handle the data, the business considerations of cost effectiveness, and the new technical field of engineering and analysis techniques for distributed processing across nodes. Cloud computing is a paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable physical or virtual resources with self-service provisioning and administration on demand. There are several key characteristics often present in for cloud computing deployments including: broad network access, measured service, multi-tenancy, on-demand self-service, rapid elasticity and scalability, and resource pooling. Cloud computing is an accepted infrastructure model for development of a Big Data system. Most Big Data functional components are provided by Cloud computing, helping systems achieve characteristics of volume, velocity, and variety. Customers may develop their own Big Data system on top of PaaS or IaaS, or use Big Data service via SaaS.  Integrating datasets can result in the creation of personally identifiable information (PII) even when PII this was not present in the individual datasets. This problem pre-dated the big data regime. For small sample sizes, it has been shown in a number of cases that individuals can be identified from their activity, for example in health datasets or in movies watched. This concern is heightened now that so much data is available about individuals on the web and in social media. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard interactive and programming language designed for querying, updating, and managing data and data set in the database management system.  SQL was first published as ISO International Standard (ISO/IEC 9075) in 1987, and it has been revised to include a larger set of features as the query language for Information technology.  SQL is designed for manipulating structured data, and it is also fast becoming the default language for big data analytics. SQL provides a mature and comprehensive framework for data access supporting a broad range of advanced analytical features. Analytics is a must-have functional component of data warehouse and big data. Modern SQL databases support the discovery of columns across a wide range of data set: not only relational table/views, but also XML, JSON, spatial objects, image-style objects (Binary Large Objects and Character Large Objects), and semantic objects.
