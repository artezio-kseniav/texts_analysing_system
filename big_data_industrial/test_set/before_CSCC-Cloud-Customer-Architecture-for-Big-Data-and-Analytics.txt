Customer Cloud Architecture for Big Data  and Analytics, Version 1.1      Executive Overview  Using analytics reveals patterns, trends and associations in data that help an organization understand  the behavior of the people and systems that drive its operation. Big data technology increases the  amount and variety of data that can be processed by analytics, providing a foundation for visualizations  and insights that can significantly improve business operations.     This paper considers how harnessing cloud architectures can further change the economics and  development lifecycle of these capabilities. It describes vendor neutral best practices for hosting big  data and analytics solutions (or just analytics solutions) using cloud computing. The architectural  elements described in this document will help you understand the components for leveraging various  cloud deployment models.     The primary drivers for deploying analytics solutions on cloud include:   1.  Low upfront cost of infrastructure and a reduction in the skills needed to get started.  2.  Elastic data and processing resources that grow and shrink with demand, reducing the need to   maintain capacity for the maximum workload.   3.  Mitigation against limited internal capability for meeting information governance, compliance   and security requirements.    4.  Applying more processing resources to existing data sources.  5.  Building solutions faster because it enables try and buy, rapid prototyping and shorter   procurement processes.     Cloud deployments offer a choice of private, public and hybrid architectures. Private cloud employs in- house data and processing components running behind corporate firewalls. Public cloud offers services  over the internet with data and computing resources available on publicly assessable servers. Hybrid  environments have a mixture of components running as both in-house and public services.    It is important to have this choice of cloud deployment because location is one of the first architectural  decisions for an analytics cloud project. In particular, where should the data be located and where  should the analytics processing be located relative to the location of the data? Legal and regulatory  requirements may also impact where data can be located since many countries have data sovereignty  laws that prevent data about individuals, finances and intellectual property from moving across country  borders.    The choice of cloud architectures allows compute components to be moved near data to optimize  processing when data volume and bandwidth limitations produce remote data bottlenecks.    For example, consider an existing data set that is very large or highly volatile. It would be expensive to   Copyright  2015 Cloud Standards Customer Council  move, so the analytics processing system may need to access this data from its current storage location.  The amount of data that the analytics processing system needs would then determine whether the  analytics needs to be hosted with this data, or whether it can use APIs to retrieve the data it needs  remotely.     Much of the data that an organization might process with analytics could be generated by existing  systems and the log files and related documents that accompany it. This may then be augmented with  data from third parties and new applications that are born on the cloud. Your cloud architecture needs  to make trade-offs for where the data is to be accumulated and processed.    Analytics has a development lifecycle that also impacts where data is optimally located and managed.  The first phase is the discovery and exploration of data. In this phase a catalog is used to discover  (locate) the data to analyse. They then access the data and explore its values using analytics tools. The  second phase is the development of the analytics model and finally, phase three is the deployment of  the analytics model into production.     Each phase may run in the same cloud environment or be distributed in different locations. Typically  phase one and two (the discovery, exploration and analytical model development) is collated with a vast  collection of different types of data that has been harvested from its original sources. For phase three,  the completed analytical models may be deployed with this data, or placed close to where this data is  being generated, or where the resulting insight will be acted upon. Wherever the analytics model is  deployed, it is accompanied by new data collection processes that gather the results of the analytics so  they can be improved with another iteration of the analytics development lifecycle.    The architecture of the analytics cloud solution may evolve as this solution matures. Preliminary and  proof-of-concept (POC) applications often start in public cloud environments where new resources can  be acquired and evaluated quickly with a minimal procurement process. Development and deployment  costs can then be estimated based on initial usage metrics. Development speed is generally enhanced  via continuous release methodologies and by leveraging Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a  Service (SaaS). The cost model of paying for what you use, as you need it, is an attractive benefit of  public cloud deployment for evaluating new approaches.     Organizations needing on-premises data storage and processing cite data privacy, security and legal  constraints as chief motivations. Large data sets that cannot be moved and local operational  requirements are other factors that favor in-house provisioning. Private cloud deployment is a solution  that generally offers the most efficient access to this secure data while maintaining access to internally  shared software and analytics.    Hybrid cloud deployment is emerging as a preferred choice of customers who want to balance their  requirements and costs. Critical data and processing remains in the enterprise data center, while other  resources are deployed in public cloud environments. Processing resources can be further optimized  with a hybrid topology that enables cloud analytics engines to work with on-premises data. This  leverages enhanced cloud software deployment and update cycles while keeping data inside the  firewall.     Another benefit is the ability to develop applications on dedicated resource pools in a hybrid cloud  deployment that eliminates the need to compromise on configuration details like processors, GPUs,  memory, networking and even software licensing constraints. The resulting solution can be   Copyright  2015 Cloud Standards Customer Council  subsequently deployed to an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud service that offers compute  capabilities matching the dedicated hardware environment which would be otherwise hosted on  premises. This feature is fast becoming a differentiator for cloud applications that need to hit the ground  running with the right configuration to meet real-world demand.     Figure 1 shows the elements that may be needed for any big data analytics solution across three  domains: public networks, provider clouds, and enterprise networks.     The public network and enterprise network domains contain data sources that feed the entire  architecture. Data sources include traditional systems of record from the enterprise as well as emerging  sources from Internet of Things (IoT).     The provider cloud uses data integration components and potentially streaming computing to capture  this combined data into data repositories where analytics can be performed to deliver actionable  insights. These insights are used by users and enterprise applications as well as stored in data storage  systems. All of this is done in a secure and governed environment.     Results are delivered to users and applications using transformation and connectivity components which  provide secure messaging and translations into systems of engagement, enterprise data, and enterprise  applications.        Figure 1: Elements of Big Data and Analytics Solutions   Copyright  2015 Cloud Standards Customer Council   Cloud Customer Architecture for Big Data and Analytics  Figure 2 illustrates a simplified enterprise cloud architecture for big data and analytics.         Figure 2: Cloud Components for Big Data and Analytics     Big data architecture in a cloud computing environment has many similarities to a traditional data  center. Data is collected and staged by data integration so it can be prepared for intended consumers.  The data is collected from structured and non-structured data sources, including real-time data from  stream computing, and maintained in enterprise data stores. Common metadata and semantic  definitions are added to enterprise data repositories. Data repositories provide staging areas for the  different types of data. The data repositories provide the development environment for new analytics  models or enhancements of existing models. Once the models are executed, their outcome is provided  for use as actionable insight via information views into the data which are also exposed for ad-hoc  analysis by end users or other applications on the client premises. Data is transformed and augmented  as it moves through the processing chain.    Information governance and security subsystems encompass each processing phase to ensure  regulation and policies for all data are defined and enabled across the system. Compliance is tracked to  ensure controls are delivering expected results. Security covers all elements including generated data  and analytics.     Users are broadly classified in two ways: enterprise and third party. Enterprise users access resources on  premises or via a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN). Data is available directly and through   Copyright  2015 Cloud Standards Customer Council  applications that provide reports and analytics. Transformation and connectivity gateways assist by  preparing information for use by enterprise applications as well as use on different devices, including  mobile, web browsers and desktop systems. Third party users gain access to the provider cloud or the  enterprise network via edge services that secure access to users with proper credentials. Access to other  resources may be further restricted as dictated by corporate policy.    The remainder of this section describes the various components in detail.  Public Network  The public network contains elements that exist in the internet: data sources, users and the edge  services needed to access the provider cloud or enterprise network.     Data sources contain all of the external sources of data for the data analytics solutions that flow from  the internet.    Users set up or use the results of the analytical system, and are typically part of the enterprise. Users  can be administrative type users, setting up the analytical processing system; analytical services users,  using the results of the analytical system; or enterprise users, invoking enterprise applications in the  analytical system. In the case of enterprise users, the access path may not go through the public internet  and may go directly to the analytical insights or enterprise applications.     When the data or user requests comes from the external internet, the flow may come through edge  services  including DNS servers, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), firewalls, and load balancers before  entering the cloud providers data integration or data streaming entry points.  Data Sources  There can be a number of different information sources in a typical big data  system, some of which enterprises are just beginning to include in their data  analytics solutions. High velocity, volume, variety and data inconsistency  often kept many types of data from being used extensively. Big data tools  have enabled organizations to use this data; however, these typically run on- premises and can require substantial upfront investment. Cloud computing  helps mitigate that investment and the associated risk by providing big data  tools via a pay per use model. Data sources include:   Machine &  Sensor   Data generated by devices, sensors, networks and related  automated systems including Internet of Things (IoT).   Image & Video   Data capturing any form of media (pictures, videos, etc.)  which can be annotated with tags, keywords and other  metadata.   Social   Internet   Data for information, messages and pictures/videos created  in virtual communities and networks.   Data stored on websites, mobile devices and other internet- connected systems.    Copyright  2015 Cloud Standards Customer Council  Data analysts who perform a variety of tasks related to collecting, organizing, and interpreting   information. In a cloud computing environment, such users will typically access information  from streaming or data repositories, and make decisions on mechanics of data integration (such  as the type of data integration services that should be used, the type of cleansing that needs to  be performed, etc.).       Data scientists who extract knowledge from data by leveraging their strong foundation in   computer science, data modeling, statistics, analytics and math. Data scientists play the role of  part analyst, part artist and will sift through all incoming data with the goal of discovering a  previously hidden insight, which in turn can provide a competitive advantage or address a  pressing business problem.       Business users who are interested in information that will enable them to make decisions critical   to tactical and strategic business operations.       Solution architects who are responsible for identifying the components needed from the cloud         Third Party   Data used to augment and enhance existing data with new  attributes like demographics, geospatial or CRM.   User  The User is a role that describes an enterprise user or third party user.     Users perform multiple roles, including:     provider in order to solve business problems.     The capabilities required to support the cloud user include:         Self-service - enables users to sign up, customize the analytical  processing, and access the output from the analytic systems and  solutions without having to talk to a person on the phone or wait  weeks for approval. The user may be an employee of the  enterprise, the cloud provider, or some other third party.        Visualization - enables users to drive dashboards to explore and interact with data from the   data repositories, actionable insight applications, or enterprise applications. The user must be  authorized to access the visualization.    Edge Services  Edge Services - Edge services include services needed to allow data to flow safely from the internet into  the data analytics processing system hosted on either the cloud provider or in the enterprise. Edge  services also allow users to communicate safely with the analytical system and enterprise applications.  These include:      Copyright  2015 Cloud Standards Customer Council  Domain Name System Server: Resolves the URL for a particular   web resource to the TCP-IP address of the system or service which  can deliver that resource.      Content Delivery Networks (CDN): CDNs are not typically used for   data source flows. For user flows, CDNs provide geographically  distributed systems of servers deployed to minimize the response  time for serving resources to geographically distributed users,  ensuring that content is highly available and provided to users with  minimum latency. Which servers are engaged will depend on  server proximity to the user and where the content is stored or cached.        Firewall: Controls communication access to or from a system permitting only traffic meeting a  set of policies to proceed and blocking any traffic which does not meet the policies. Firewalls  can be implemented as separate dedicated hardware, or as a component in other networking  hardware such as a load-balancer or router or as integral software to an operating system.   Load Balancers: Provide distribution of network or application traffic across many resources  (such as computers, processors, storage, or network links) to maximize throughput, minimize  response time, increase capacity and increase reliability of applications. Load balancers can  balance loads locally and globally. Load balancers should be highly available without a single  point of failure. Load balancers are sometimes integrated as part of the provider cloud analytical  system components like stream processing, data integration and repositories.   Provider Cloud   Provider cloud hosts components to prepare data for analytics, store data, run analytical systems and  process the results of those systems.     Provider cloud elements include:        Data Integration    Streaming Computing    Data Repositories    Actionable Insight    Transformation and Connectivity     A cloud computing environment often allows provisioning decisions to be delayed until data volume,  velocity and related processing requirements are better understood. Experimentation and iteration  using different cloud service configurations is rapidly becoming a preferred way to understand and  refine requirements without upfront capital investment.     Data Integration - Data integration copies and correlates information from  disparate sources to produce meaningful associations related to primary business  dimensions. A complete data integration solution encompasses discovery,  cleansing, monitoring, transforming and delivery of data. Information provisioning  methods include ETL, ELT, event-based processing, services, federation, change  data capture with replication and continuous stream ingestion.    Copyright  2015 Cloud Standards Customer Council   Data to be integrated can come from public network data sources, enterprise data sources, or streaming  computing results. The results from data integration can feed streaming computing, be passed to data  repositories for analytical processing, or passed to enterprise data for storage or feeding into enterprise  applications.     A cloud computing environment allows data storage technology and physical location to change over  time. Processing components can be moved closer to data as dictated by usage and bandwidth. Data can  also be moved to more cost-effective storage containers as it ages or is no longer needed for ongoing  analytics.     Capabilities required for data integration include:      Data Staging   Data Quality   Converting data to the appropriate formats for downstream processing.    Cleaning and organizing data to remove redundancies and inconsistencies so that it  more readily aligns with systems of record and enterprise data.    Transformation  and Load   Leveraging integration and quality capabilities to transform incoming data so it can  be loaded into the data warehouses and databases used for reporting and analytics.     Streaming Computing - Stream processing systems can ingest and process large  volumes of highly dynamic, time-sensitive continuous data streams from a variety  of inputs such as sensor-based monitoring devices, messaging systems and  financial market feeds. The store-and-pull model of traditional data processing  environments is not suitable for this class of low-latency or real-time streaming  applications where data needs to be processed on the fly as it arrives. Capabilities  include:     Real Time Analytical  Processing    Applying analytic processing and decision making to in-motion and transient data with  minimal latency.    Data Augmentation   Filtering and diverting in-motion data to data warehouses for deeper background  analysis.     Cloud services allow streaming computing to be adapted as data volume and velocity changes. Adding  virtual memory, processors and storage can accommodate peaks in demand. The option to add  dedicated hardware can also help with specialized processing needs.     Data Repositories -The data stored in the cloud environment is organized into  repositories. These repositories may be hosted on different infrastructure that is  tuned to support the types of analytics workload accessing the data. The data  that is stored in the repositories may come from legacy, new and streaming  sources, enterprise applications, enterprise data, cleansed and reference data,  as well as output from streaming analytics.     Types of data repositories include:     Copyright  2015 Cloud Standards Customer Council   Catalog   Data Virtualization     Landing, Exploration &  Archive   Deep Analytics &  Modeling   Interactive Analysis &  Reporting   Results from discovery and IT data curation create a consolidated  view of information that is reflected in a catalog. The introduction  of big data increases the need for catalogs that describe what  data is stored, its classification, ownership and related  information governance definitions. From this catalog it is  possible to control the usage of the data.    Agile approach to data management that allows an application to  retrieve and manipulate data without requiring technical details  about the data    Allows for large datasets to be stored, explored and augmented  using a wide variety of tools since massive and unstructured  datasets may mean that it is no longer feasible to design the data  set before entering any data. Data may be used for archival  purposes with improved availability and resiliency thanks to  multiple copies distributed across commodity storage.    The application of statistical models to yield information from  large data sets comprised of both unstructured and semi- structured elements. Deep analysis involves precisely targeted  and complex queries with results measured in petabytes and  exabytes. Requirements for real-time or near-real-time responses  are becoming more common.    Tools to answer business and operations questions over internet  scale datasets. Tools also leverage popular spreadsheet interfaces  for self-service data access and visualization.       SaaS APIs implemented by data repositories allow output to be efficiently consumed by applications.    Actionable Insight - Data collected, processed and stored in the data repositories may be used by  business applications to derive insights that ultimately drive actions. Examples include:        Analysis of millions of streaming transaction records may flag some transactions as suspicious   which may warrant further investigation.      Analysis of large scale Call Detail Records for a telecom operator may detect abnormally low call   quality in a region that warrants further analysis.     Such applications can be delivered by a cloud service provider using a SaaS or PaaS model that requires a  subset of data residing in the data repositories.    Creating actionable insight means relating new data with existing information in a convincing and  understandable manner. Today, this work is ad hoc and executed by highly technical data scientists, but  in the future, tools can enable Line-of-Business and other analysts to become more productive.     Statistics with a focus on regression analysis are the primary tools used to correlate and ultimately align  messy data. Text analytics and various search tools are also part of this fundamental data preparation  activity that results in more data aligned to the primary reporting dimensions of an organization.   Copyright  2015 Cloud Standards Customer Council  Because there are complex associations combined with high data volumes,  visualizations are often needed to share an idea or drive consensus. As more  data is collected over time, predictive algorithms are often employed to project  data into the future.     Finally, because data is generally held in its original form for longer periods of  time, it is possible to create multiple correlation and prediction algorithms to  drive organizations towards better analytics and, ultimately, the best supported  version of the truth.    There are a number of related applications available today. The types of  applications include:     Decision  Management   Includes analytics-based decision management that enable organizations to make  automated decisions backed by analytics, improve efficiency and enable  collaboration. They also include operational decision management systems that rely  on rules (which may in turn be augmented by analytics) to augment enterprise  decision making to achieve specific business objectives (such as prevent a customer  from churning, converting a visitor to a client, ordering more inventory, etc.).       Offers easy exploration across a variety of sources to provide business users with  extensive new visibility into business performance without spending a huge amount  of time specifying requirements for the system. Data discovery tools allow users to  easily explore and understand this diverse data without having to build advanced  queries or reports.   Extracts information from existing datasets to determine the current state, identify  patterns and predict future trends.    Reports of operational and warehouse data to business stakeholders and regulators  where big data typically increases the scope and depth of available data.    Enables businesses to gain insight and understanding from their structured and  unstructured content (also referred to as textual data). A large percentage of the  information in a company is maintained as unstructured content, such as documents,  blobs of text in database, wikis, etc.    Enables faster and more efficient development of plans, budgets and forecasts by  creating, comparing and evaluating business scenarios.     Discovery &  Exploration   Predictive Analytics   Analysis & Reporting   Content Analytics   Planning &  Forecasting     Transformation and Connectivity - The transformation and connectivity  component enables secure connections to enterprise systems with the ability  to filter, aggregate, modify or reformat data as needed. Data transformation  is often required when data doesnt fit enterprise applications. Key  capabilities include:       Copyright  2015 Cloud Standards Customer Council   Page 10 Enterprise Security  Connectivity   Transformations   Enterprise Data  Connectivity   API Management   Monitors usage and secures results as information is transferred to and from the cloud  provider services domain into the enterprise network to enterprise applications and  enterprise data. Works with security capabilities and enterprise user directory.  Transforms data between analytical systems and enterprise systems. Data is improved  and augmented as it moves through the processing chain.     Provides ability for analytics system components to connect securely to enterprise  data.     Publishes, catalogues and updates APIs in a wide variety of deployment environments.  Developers and end users need to rapidly assemble solutions therefore discovery and  reuse of existing data, analytics and services is a fundamental requirement.        Enterprise Network  Within enterprise networks, enterprises typically host a number of applications that deliver critical  business solutions along with supporting infrastructure like data storage. Typically, applications will have  sources of data that are extracted and integrated with services provided by the cloud provider. Analysis  is performed in the cloud computing environment with output consumed by on-premises applications.  Any data from enterprise applications can be sent to enterprise or departmental systems of record  represented by the enterprise data components. Systems of record data have generally been matured  over time and are highly trusted. It remains a primary element in reporting and predictive analytics  solutions. Systems of record data sources include transactional data about or from business interactions  that adhere to a sequence or related processes (financial or logistical). This data  can come from reference data, master data repositories, and application data  used by or produced by business solutions functionally or operationally.  Typically the data has been improved or augmented to add value and drive  insight. Enterprise data may in turn be input into the analysis process through  data integration or directly to the data repositories as appropriate.     Enterprise Data - Enterprise data includes metadata about the data as well as  systems of record for enterprise applications. Enterprise data may flow directly  to data integration or the data repositories providing a feedback loop in the  analytical system.  Enterprise data includes:       Reference Data   Provide context about collected data.   Master Data  Repositories   Transactional   Application   These repositories can be updated with the output of analytics, to assist with  subsequent data transformation, enrichment and correlation. They can host  analytics and feed other analytics models when they execute.   Data about or from business interactions that adhere to a sequence or related  processes (financial or logistical). This data can come from reference data, master  data repositories, and distributed data storage.   Data used by or produced by business solutions functionally or operationally.  Typically the data has been improved or augmented to add value and drive insight.  This data can come from enterprise applications running in the enterprise.   Copyright  2015 Cloud Standards Customer Council   Page 11Log Data   Data aggregated from log files for enterprise applications, systems, infrastructure,  security, governance, etc.   Enterprise Content  Data   Data to support any enterprise applications.   Historical Data   Data from past analytics and enterprise applications and systems.     Enterprise User Directory  Provides storage for and access to user information to support  authentication, authorization, or profile data. The security services and edge services use this to drive  access to the enterprise network, enterprise services, or enterprise specific cloud provider services.     Enterprise Applications - Enterprise applications can consume cloud provider data and analytics to  produce results that address business goals and objectives. Time to value and agility are primary drivers  that draw organizations to a cloud solution. Distributed applications are assembled using APIs that  promote reuse of existing services rather than writing custom code. Continuous delivery of  improvements, bug fixes and features are fundamental cloud advantages. Upgrades can be applied  across a system in minutes instead of days or weeks. Applications include:     Customer Experience   New Business Models   Financial Performance   Risk   IT Economics   Operations and Fraud                     Customer-facing cloud systems can be a primary system  of engagement that drives new business and helps  service existing clients with lower initial cost.    Alternative business models that focus on low cost, fast  response and great interactions are all examples of  opportunities driven by cloud solutions.    The office of finance should become more efficient as  data is consolidated and reported faster and easier than  in the past.    Having more data available across a wider domain  means that risk analytics are more effective. Elastic  resource management means more processing power is  available in times of heightened threat.   IT operations are streamlined as capital expenditures are  reduced while performance and features are improved  by cloud deployments.   Cloud solutions can provide faster access to more data  allowing for more accurate analytics that flag suspicious  activity and offer remediation in a timely manner.       Security   The lifecycle of big data from raw input sources to valuable insights and sharing of data among many  users and application components requires rigorous security consideration at each step. Security  services enable identity and access management, protection of data and applications as well as   Copyright  2015 Cloud Standards Customer Council   Page 12  Identity and  Access  Management   Data and  Application  protection      Security  Intelligence   Enables authentication and authorization (access management) as well as privileged identity  management. Access management ensures each user is authenticated and has the right access  to the environment to perform their task based on their role (i.e. data analysts, data scientists,  business users, solution architects). Capabilities should include granular access control (giving  users more precision for sharing data) and single sign on facility across big data sources and  repositories, data integration, data transformation and analytics components. Privileged  identity management capabilities protects, automates and audits the use of privileged identities  to help protect from abuse of roles which have enhanced access rights, to thwart insider threats  and improve security across the extended enterprise, including cloud environments. This  capability generally uses an enterprise user directory.   Enables and supports data encryption, infrastructure and network protection, application  security, data activity monitoring, and data provenance where:     Data encryption supports the ability to secure the data interchange between components   to achieve confidentiality and integrity with robust encryption of data at rest as well as  data in transit.   Infrastructure / Network protection supports the ability to monitor the traffic and  communication between the different nodes (like distributed analytical processing nodes)  as well as prevent man-in-the-middle, DoS attacks. This will also alert on the presence of  any bad actors/nodes in the environment.        Application security supports security as part of the development, delivery and execution  of application components including tools to secure and scan applications as part of the  application development lifecycle. This component helps eliminate security vulnerabilities  from components that access critical data before they are deployed into production.     Data activity monitoring supports tracking all queries submitted and maintaining an audit   trail for all queries run by a job. The component will provide reports on sensitive data  access to understand who is accessing which objects in the data sources.     Data provenance provides traceability of origin, ownership and accuracy of the data and   complements audit logs for compliance requirements.      Enables security information event management, protection of Personally Identifiable  Information (PII or privacy), audit and compliance support that provides comprehensive  visibility and actionable intelligence that can help detect and defend against threats through  analysis of events and logs and correlation. High risk threats detected can be integrated with  enterprise incident management processes. This component enables audit capability to show  that the analytics delivered by the big data platform sufficiently protects PII and delivers  anonymity as well as enabling automated regulatory compliance reporting.     providing actionable security intelligence across cloud and enterprise environments.  It uses the catalog  to understand the location and classification of the data it is protecting.       Information Governance   Information governance provides the policies and capabilities that enable the analytics environment to  move, manage and govern data. It has management interfaces to enable the business team to control  and operate the processes that manage data. It provides protection classification and rules for managing  and monitoring access, masking and encryption. It also provides workflow for coordinating changes to  the data repositories, catalog, data and supporting infrastructure between different teams.    Cloud governance aims to reduce redundancies, improve flow and ultimately improve compliance by  offering a wide range of services that minimally impact the underlying business processes. Similarly,   Copyright  2015 Cloud Standards Customer Council   Page 13   Security systems aim to limit threats and provide a wider variety of information to only the people who  are authorized to use it.   The Complete Picture  Figure 3 provides a more detailed architectural view of components, subcomponents and relationships  for a cloud-based analytics solution that provides historical analysis of an organizations data.          Figure 3: Detailed Components Diagram      Copyright  2015 Cloud Standards Customer Council   Page 14  Runtime Flow  Figure 4 illustrates the flow of a typical use case for Fraud and Identity Theft analytics applications.             Figure 4: Flow for Fraud and Identity Theft     In this example, a compliance and security analyst is looking to investigate fraud and identity theft  threats related to banking operations.  Yellow flows show the interactions of the compliance officers  while blue flows show the flow of data across the analytical system.    Basic information flow includes:     1.  Enterprise compliance officers customize and configure the analytical processing system on the   cloud provider to look at banking transaction data from the enterprise as well as social media  feeds from the public network to look for identity theft and correlate financial activity.     Edge services use security capabilities and enterprise user directories to validate third party and  enterprise users and secure provider cloud access according to governance policy.     2.  Data flows from public data sources like social media through edge services which route the   data to the data integration components in the provider cloud.     3.  Data integration components are used to extract data from bank transactions, credit   Copyright  2015 Cloud Standards Customer Council   Page 15  applications, client name and address changes along with financial information from related  institutions. Social media feeds are harvested for current location and activities. Collected and  correlated data is enriched with directory information stored on premises to associate bank  account information to past, current and new customers. Enterprise data stores are augmented  with summary data as required by dependent applications.     5.   4.  Credit card transactions are forwarded directly to streaming computing components. In some  cases, correlation of streaming data with other information is used to flag outliers and other  potential threats. For example, client names need to be enriched with last known location  (perhaps from social media) to provide alerts about the same customer being in more than one  place at one time.    Incoming data from structured and streaming sources, along with related streaming analytics,  are cached in the landing, exploration and archive component within data repositories. Other  data is largely historical in nature. It requires complex, multi-pass machine learning algorithms  to detect and flag unusual behavior. One example is entity analytics which seeks to distinguish  clients with the same name and alternatively highlight people with different web identifiers, like  email addresses and user names that actually represent the same individual.     6.  Data that is flagged for further investigation is investigated by a case management team that   run ad hoc analytics against new and historic data to find outliers and other abnormal  behaviour. The result of this analysis is ultimately fed back into the process and enterprise  applications to capture subsequent instances of fraud.      7.  After data has been collected, cleansed, transformed and stored it is communicated to   enterprise applications which help stakeholders make decisions. These enterprise applications  can be delivered via SaaS requiring only data repositories to be changed to address a given  reporting problem.     Decision management applications are used to determine whether a case should be opened for  further investigation and action by the Fraud and Identity Theft team. The predictive analytics  applications are used to classify incoming transactions against an established profile and flag  potential outliers that represent identity theft threats. Analysis and reporting applications are  used to provide dashboards that depict threat volume and severity. Risk analytics measure  threats to the business arising from high profile threats including executive identity theft and  brand fraud.       Relevant data from the data repositories (landing, exploration and archive in our case) and the  cloud providers applications is then extracted via the transformation and connectivity layer to  enhance client-specific threats, provide regulatory information about the steps taken to improve  overall identity protection for customers and the business.     8.  At the end of the analytical process, enterprise users, such as compliance officers, use   visualizations and interactive tools to provide alternative views of data and analytics. They  promote better understanding of results by showing important areas of interest, highlighting  outliers, offering innovative ways to refine and filter complex data, and by encouraging deeper  exploration and discovery.      Copyright  2015 Cloud Standards Customer Council   Page 16   Sometimes applications and related data may be made available to third party users who would  access the enterprise applications via edge services which, in turn, collaborate with security  services and the enterprise user directory.     Cloud architecture makes this type of solution easier to implement and maintain. As demand increases,  more resources must be acquired. The introduction of feedback loops to introduce new analytics is  made easier by cloud APIs that formalize the interactions between components. Continuous flow of data  and updating of applications means that users can get the latest upgrades faster and easier.     Deployment Considerations  Cloud environments offer tremendous flexibility with less concern for how components are physically  connected. The need for advanced planning is reduced but still important. This section offers  suggestions for better provisioning of data and computing resources.    Initial Criteria       Elasticity    CPU and Computation    Data Volume    Data Bandwidth       Information Governance and Security   No single cloud environment optimizes all these criteria. A little advanced planning goes a long way  towards ensuring user satisfaction  and it helps keep costs in line with expectations.      Elasticity   CPU and  Computation   Data Volume   Elasticity is the ability for a cloud solution to provision and de-provision computing  resources on demand as workloads change. Public clouds have a distinct advantage since  they generally have larger pools of resources available. You also benefit by only paying for  what you use. Private clouds and dedicated hardware can makeup some of the difference  with higher bandwidth data paths.    The availability of inexpensive commodity processors means the private and hybrid cloud  server farms are more viable than in the past. Modern development environments using  Hadoop, Spark and Jupyter (iPython) take advantage of these massively parallel systems.  Streams and high speed analytics are an emerging area where cloud applications leverage  more powerful processor pools to enable real-time, in-motion data solutions. Dedicated  hardware allows for faster development and testing prior to migration towards hybrid and  public environments.   All data loses relevance over time. Data retention requires a little experimentation unless  specifically governed by regulatory or other policies. Public clouds offer the flexibility to  store varying amounts of data with no advance provisioning. In-house cloud storage  solutions can offer long term storage cost advantages when volume is predicted in  advance.    Data Bandwidth   Public and private clouds need to be optimized for big data. Large cloud data sets requiring  fast access benefit from processing components with fast and efficient data access. In  many cases, this means moving the processor to data, or vice versa. Cloud systems can  effectively hide the physical location of data and analytics. Tuning activities can be carried   Copyright  2015 Cloud Standards Customer Council   Page 17  Information  Governance and  Security    out continuously with minimal impact on deployed applications.    As more data about people, financial transactions and operational decisions is collected,  refined and stored, the challenges related to information governance and security  increase.  Information governance policies must encompass a wider domain of data and ultimately  deal with the results of related analytics that create sensitive data from inputs that are not  themselves subject to safeguards. The simple fact that more people have access to data  calls for better monitoring and compliance strategies. The cloud generally allows for faster  deployment of new compliance and monitoring tools that encourage agile policy and  compliance frameworks.  Cloud data hubs can be a good option by acting as focal points for data assembly and  distribution. Tools that monitor activity and data access can actually make cloud systems  more secure than standalone systems. Hybrid systems offer unique application  governance features: software can be centrally maintained in a distributed environment  with data stored in-house to meet jurisdictional policies.   Optimized  Provisioning    Optimized cloud provisioning can help you select the right product family for a given set of  usage criteria.        Figure 5 shows typical scenarios in a worksheet format that balances trade-offs between architectures.  Primary criteria drive the initial architectural choice. One or more secondary criteria will tend to move  the selection needle between public and private topologies.

They are not the most common choice for  enterprise customers. Lower bandwidth, less powerful compute environments, along with governance  and compliance concerns can limit the appeal of the traditional public cloud.     Copyright  2015 Cloud Standards Customer Council   Page 18   Many organizations are using public cloud services to build social and mobile  applications and improve the user experience. The data sources for these  applications range from large social media datasets to low latency updates  based on social messaging. Linking these mobile and social systems (systems  of engagement) to core business systems (systems of record) can provide  greater customer insight and value. Organizations are using application  programming interfaces (APIs) to provide access to traditional systems and  data in a form that is easier to use with social and mobile applications.      Customers typically use a private cloud and switch to a public cloud in the  event of a disaster to recover files. Applications and data are duplicated and  synced in the public cloud. Large datasets are kept up-to-date with a mixture  of continuous data transfer and smart analysis of content that minimizes  bandwidth usage.        Backup location for disaster  recovery     The Hybrid Cloud  An enterprise routinely needs a combination of public and on-premises components that when linked,  create a hybrid cloud. There are several different definitions of what constitutes a hybrid cloud.  Generally speaking, it will have two or more cloud implementations with different capabilities, user  interfaces and control mechanisms.     Typical examples include on-premises implementations, different public clouds, public cloud and on- premises implementations, etc.   Businesses implementing hybrid clouds are looking for flexibility and agility in delivering new  capabilities.     A few examples include:      Integrating social/mobile  with core business systems     Hybrid Cloud Management     Although there are many features that make hybrid clouds appealing there are implementation  challenges. One challenge is that by their very nature, hybrid cloud implementations involve different  products and platforms. Each platform has its own way of doing things, including but not limited to  tasks, such as:        Configuring sets of resources, such as setting up networks or IP address pools      Deploying new resources, such as creating a new virtual machine      Monitoring the status of resources      Starting and stopping virtual machines      It is difficult, even for trained administrators who work with the platforms on a daily basis, to handle the  different interfaces and different capabilities. Productivity and quality both suffer as they shift from  product to product and are forced to change their perspectives.      Copyright  2015 Cloud Standards Customer Council   Page 19   The challenge is even greater for casual users, ones who only occasionally need to perform routine  tasks, such as restarting their application systems. Expecting them to master a variety of tools for  different platforms is unreasonable.     The solution is to provide unified single pane of glass management across the various clouds that are  linked in a hybrid manner. A common, integrated administration and systems management tool that  works across platforms is needed, as well as easily deployed patterns of expertise that can be used on  the various cloud sites.
