ITU-T Y.3600 (11/2015)   i       FOREWORD   The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is  the United Nations specialized agency in the field of  telecommunications,  information  and  communication  technologies  (ICTs).  The  ITU  Telecommunication  Standardization  Sector  (ITU-T)  is  a  permanent  organ  of  ITU.  ITU-T  is  responsible  for  studying  technical,  operating  and  tariff  questions  and  issuing  Recommendations  on  them  with  a  view  to  standardizing  telecommunications on a worldwide basis.   The  World  Telecommunication  Standardization  Assembly  (WTSA),  which  meets  every  four  years,  establishes  the  topics  for  study  by  the  ITU-T  study  groups  which,  in  turn,  produce  Recommendations  on  these topics.   The approval of ITU-T Recommendations is covered by the procedure laid down in WTSA Resolution 1.   In  some  areas  of  information  technology  which  fall  within  ITU-T's  purview,  the  necessary  standards  are  prepared on a collaborative basis with ISO and IEC.            NOTE   In  this  Recommendation,  the  expression  "Administration"  is  used  for  conciseness  to  indicate  both  a  telecommunication administration and a recognized operating agency.   Compliance  with  this  Recommendation  is  voluntary.  However,  the  Recommendation  may  contain  certain  mandatory  provisions  (to  ensure,  e.g.,  interoperability  or  applicability)  and  compliance  with  the  Recommendation  is  achieved  when  all  of  these  mandatory  provisions  are  met.  The  words  "shall"  or  some  other obligatory language such as "must" and the negative equivalents are used to express requirements. The  use of such words does not suggest that compliance with the Recommendation is required of any party.               INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS  ITU  draws  attention  to  the  possibility  that  the  practice  or  implementation  of  this  Recommendation  may  involve  the  use  of  a  claimed  Intellectual  Property  Right.  ITU  takes  no  position  concerning  the  evidence,  validity or applicability of claimed Intellectual Property Rights, whether asserted by ITU members or others  outside of the Recommendation development process.   As  of  the  date  of  approval  of  this  Recommendation,  ITU  had  received  notice  of  intellectual  property,  protected  by  patents,  which  may  be  required  to  implement  this  Recommendation.  However,  implementers  are cautioned that this may not represent the latest information and are therefore strongly urged to consult the  TSB patent database at http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/ipr/.

Data are generated by many sources and not only by sensors, cameras or  network  devices,  but  also  by  web  pages,  email  systems  and  social  networks  as  well  as  by  many  other sources. Datasets are becoming so large and so complex or are arriving so fast that traditional  data  processing  methods  and  tools  are  inadequate.  Efficient  analytics  of  data  within  tolerable  elapsed times becomes very challenging. The paradigm being developed to resolve the above issues  is called big data.   For the purpose of this Recommendation it is understood, that within  the big data ecosystem, data  types include structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. Structured data are often stored in  databases which may be organized in different models, such as relational models, document models,  key-value models, graph models, etc. Semi-structured data does not conform to the formal structure  of data models, but  contain tags or markers to  identify data.  Unstructured data do not  have a pre- defined  data  model  and  are  not  organized  in  any  defined  manner.  Within  all  data  types  data  can  exist in formats, such as text, spreadsheet, video, audio, image, map, etc.   Big  data  are  successfully  used  in  many  fields,  if  traditional  methods  and  tools  have  become  inefficient, where data processing is characterized by scale (volume), diversity (variety), high speed  (velocity)  and  possibly  other  criteria  like  credibility  (veracity)  or  business  value.  These  characteristics, usually called the Vs, can be explained as follows:         Volume: refers to the amount of data collected, stored, analysed and visualized, which big  data technologies need to resolve;   Variety:  refers  to  different  data  types  and  data  formats  that  are  processed  by  big  data  technologies;         Rec. ITU-T Y.3600 (11/2015)   3          Velocity:  refers  to  both  how  fast  the  data  is  being  collected  and  how  fast  the  data  is  processed by big data technologies to deliver expected results.   NOTE  Additionally, veracity refers to the uncertainty of  the data and value refers to the business results  from the gains in new information using big data technologies. Other Vs can be considered as well.   Taking  into  account  the  above  Vs'  described  characteristics,  big  data  technologies  and  services  allow many new challenges to be resolved and also create more new opportunities than ever before:               Heterogeneity and incompleteness: Data processed using big data can miss some attributes  or introduce noise in data transmission. Even after data cleaning and error correction, some  incompleteness  and  some  errors  in  data  are  likely  to  remain.  These  challenges  can  be  managed during data analysis. [b-CRA-BDWP]   Scale:  Processing  of  large  and  rapidly  increasing  volumes  of  data  is  a  challenging  task.  Using data processing technologies, the data scale challenge was mitigated by the evolution  of  processing  and  storage  resources.  Nowadays  however  data  volumes  are  scaling  faster  than resources  can  evolve. Technologies such  as parallel  databases, in  memory databases,  non-SQL databases and analytical algorithms allow this challenge to be resolved.   Timeliness: The acquisition rate and timeliness, to effectively find elements in limited time  that  meet  a  specified  criterion  in  a  large  dataset,  are  new  challenges  faced  by  data  processing. Other new challenges are related to the types of criteria specified and there is a  need to devise new index structures and responses to the queries having tight response time  limits.   Privacy:  Data  about  human  individuals,  such  as  demographic  information,  Internet  activities,  commutation  patterns,  social  interactions,  energy  or  water  consumption,  are  being collected and analysed for different purposes. Big data technologies and services are  challenged  to  protect  personal  identities  and  sensitive  attributes  of  data  throughout  the  whole data processing cycle while respecting applicable data retention policy.   Positive  resolving  of  the  above  challenges  opens  new  opportunities  to  discover  new  data  relationships, hidden patterns or unknown dependencies.   6.2   Big data ecosystem   This clause describes an environment, called the big data ecosystem through roles and sub-roles. It  also  defines  necessary  activities  for  roles providing  and  consuming  big  data  services  as  well  as  relationships between roles.   The big data ecosystem includes the following roles:            data provider;   big data service provider;   big data service customer.   The big data ecosystem is shown in Figure 6-1.   4   Rec. ITU-T Y.3600 (11/2015)       Figure 6-1  Big data ecosystem      6.2.1     Data provider (DP)   The data provider (DP) role consists of two sub-roles:         data supplier;   data broker.   6.2.1.1  Data supplier   The data supplier provides data from different sources to the data broker, which can be accessed by  the big data service provider. The data supplier's activities include:            generating data;   creating metadata information describing the data source(s) and relevant attributes;   publishing metadata information to access the metadata.   6.2.1.2  Data broker   The data broker serves to connect between the data supplier and the big data service provider. The  data broker can act as a clearinghouse, open data mart, etc. and its activities include:            providing a meta-information registry to the data supplier for publishing their data sources;   finding on-line open-data sources and registering corresponding meta-information;   providing a service catalogue to the big data service provider for searching usable data.   6.2.2  Big data service provider (BDSP)   The big data service provider (BDSP) supports capabilities for big data analytics and infrastructure.  The big  data service  provider can  act  as a form  of  big  data  platform, an  extension of the  existing  data analytics platform, etc. Big data service provider activities include:                   searching  data  sources  (from  the  data  broker)  and  collecting  data  by  requesting  and  crawling;   storing data to a data repository;   integrating data;   providing tools for data analysis and visualization;   supporting  data  management  such  as  data  provenance,  data  privacy,  data  security,  data  retention policy, data ownership, etc.   6.2.3  Big data service customer (BDC)   The big data service customer (BDC) is the end-user or is a system that uses the results or services  from  a  big  data  service  provider.  The  big  data  service  customer  may  produce  new  services  or         Rec.

Big  data  service customer activities include:          requesting big data services from the big data service provider;   using the outputs of big data services.   6.3   Relationship between cloud computing and big data   Big data refers to technologies and services which extract valuable information from the extensive  datasets  characterized  by  the  Vs,  while  cloud  computing  is,  as  defined  in  [ITU-T Y.3500],  the  paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable physical or virtual  resources with self-service provisioning and administration on-demand.   Big  data  needs  on-demand  high  performance  data  processing  and  distributed  storage  as  well  as  variety of tools required to accomplish activities of the big data  ecosystem which are described in  clause 6.2. Cloud computing meets the challenges of big data as described in clause 6.1. The burst  nature  of  workloads  makes  cloud  computing  more  appropriate  for  big  data  challenges  such  as  scalability  and  timeliness.  The  big  data  ecosystems,  which  are  supported  by  a  cloud  computing  system context, can be referred to as cloud computing based big data. Cloud computing based big  data is addressed in detail in clause 7.   7   Cloud computing based big data   This  clause  describes  a  cloud  computing  based  big  data  system  context  that  is  effective  for  supporting big data. It also provides benefits of cloud computing based big data.   7.1   Cloud computing based big data system context   Cloud computing based big data system context is described with new sub-roles and activities based  on  the  architectural  user  view  defined  in  [ITU-T  Y.3502].  This  clause  describes  how  cloud  computing can support the three main roles in a big data ecosystem: data provider, big data service  provider and big data service customer.   Cloud computing sub-roles can be mapped to big data roles as shown in Table 7-1.   Table 7-1  Mapping table between big data ecosystem roles and    cloud computing based big data system context sub-roles   Big data ecosystem roles   Cloud computing based big data system context sub-roles   Data provider   CSN:data provider   Big data service provider   CSP:big data infrastructure provider, CSP:big data application provider   Big data service customer   CSC:big data service user   Figure 7-1 illustrates the cloud computing sub-roles for big data. Figure 7-1 also identifies activities  specific  for  big  data  and  assigns  them  to  cloud  computing  sub-roles.  Arrows  used  in  Figure  7-1  show the data and service flows within a cloud computing based big data system context.   6   Rec. ITU-T Y.3600 (11/2015)       Figure 7-1  Cloud computing based big data system context      Figure 7-2 illustrates, as an example scenario, how cloud computing supports big data services from  the  viewpoints  of  CSP:  Big  data  application  providers  (BDAPs)  and  CSP:Big  data  infrastructure  providers  (BDIPs).  A  cloud  based  big  data  service,  which  is  provided  by  a  CSP:BDAP  or  a  CSP:BDIP, utilizes other sub-roles of the cloud service provider.   The  CSP  provides  services  of  application  and  platform  capability  types  such  as  software  as  a  service and platform as a service and these services can be used by the CSP:BDAP to perform data  analysis, visualization and other big data applications. In addition, the CSP:BDIP can use the cloud  services  of  cloud  infrastructure  capability  types  such  as  compute  as  a  service,  data  storage  as  a  service,  infrastructure  as  a  service  and  network  as  a  service  to  perform  big  data  services  for  data  collection, data processing, data management, etc.         Rec. ITU-T Y.3600 (11/2015)   7           Figure 7-2  An example scenario of cloud computing support for big data   NOTE  Figure 7-2 considers cloud service categories based on Table A.1 of ITU-T Y.3500.   7.1.1  CSN:data provider (CSN:DP)   CSN:data  provider  (CSN:DP)  is  the  sub-role  of  the  cloud  service  partner  (CSN)  generating  and  publishing new data or information which feeds into the big data system for discovery, access and  transformation.  The  CSP:data  provider's  activities  include  a  generate  data  activity,  a  publish  data  activity and a brokerage data activity.   7.1.1.1  Generate data activity      The  generate  data activity  involves  gathering data from  several  kinds of  sources. The data can be  generated in a variety of types such as structured data, semi-structured data and unstructured data.   The  data  sources  include  public  data  (data  from  governments,  organizations,  Internet,  etc.),  private/enterprise data and application based data, such as social network service (SNS) and Internet  of Things (IoT) data.   7.1.1.2   Publish data activity   The  publish  data  activity  is  the  process  of  registering  metadata  of  data  to  the  CSN.  It  provides  metadata for brokerage data activity.   NOTE  metadata is delivered to the CSP:BDIP through brokerage data (see clause 7.1.1.3) with the  data catalogue which includes data access methods, data use policy, etc.   7.1.1.3  Brokerage data activity   The brokerage data activity involves providing metadata of data to the CSP: BDIP.    Types of brokerage data activities include:            providing a data registry to the CSN:DP for publishing their data sources;   finding an on-line data source and registering its metadata;   providing a catalogue to the CSP:BDIP for searching appropriate data.   8   Rec. ITU-T Y.3600 (11/2015)       7.1.2  CSP: big data application provider (CSP:BDAP)   The  CSP:  big  data  application  provider  (CSP:BDAP)  is  a  sub-role  of  the  CSP  executing  a  set  of  data lifecycle operations to meet the requirements of data analysis and visualization, as well as the  security and privacy requirements. The CSP:BDAP utilizes the services from the CSP:BDIP for big  data services and provides analysis result to the CSC: big data service user (CSC:BDSU).    Types of CSP:BDAP activities include:         visualizing data;   analysing data.   7.1.2.1  Visualize data activity   The visualize data activity is responsible for presenting data with multiple styles, such as statistical  graphics,  forms,  diagrams,  charts,  reports,  etc.,  through  visualization  and  reporting  tools  and  services. The big data service user (BDSU) can easily and quickly understand the meaning of data  through data visualization. Direct interaction between reporting tools and CSC operational systems  is also supported.   Types of big data visualize activities include:            business intelligence;   data reporting;   data exploration.   7.1.2.2  Analyse data activity   The analyse data activity is a process to extract and discover useful information or valuable insights  from big data.    Types of big data analyse activities include:            statistical analysis;    predictive analysis;   content analysis.   7.1.3  CSP:big data infrastructure provider (CSP:BDIP)   CSP:big  data  infrastructure  provider  (CSP:BDIP)  is  the  sub-role  of  the  CSP  providing  cloud  computing  resources  (such  as  system  hardware,  a  network,  storage  and  computing  platforms)  in  order to execute big data processing, while protecting the privacy, retention policy and integrity of  data.    Types of CSP:BDIP activities include:                     performing data collection;   performing data storage;   providing data pre-processing;   providing data integration;   managing data protection;   managing data provenance.   7.1.3.1   Perform data collection activity   The  perform  data  collection  activity  is  responsible  for  gathering  and  searching  of  data.  Data  in  a  cloud computing environment that could be transported through Internet, such as web, video, audio,  radio  frequency  identification  (RFID),  sensor  and  social  network  data  and  data  obtained  in  other  ways can be categorized into three types as follows:         Rec.

Since there are many different data formats and data types of the collected data, the  transformation and extraction of complex data into simple structured data facilitates and speeds up  the data analysis process.   The data de-noising process filters out the defects in data to eliminate negative effects in the normal  analysis process.   7.1.3.4   Provide data integration activity   The  provide  data  integration  activity  is  responsible  for  combining,  forming,  coordinating  or  blending data from disparate sources and for solving the issues of bulk data movement, replication,  synchronization, virtualization, data quality and data services.   7.1.3.5  Manage data protection activity  The manage data protection activity is responsible for protecting data so that the protected data may  not be collected, stored and disclosed to whom may not be appropriate.   7.1.3.6  Manage data provenance activity   The manage data provenance activity manages information about the origin and generation process  methods of data. Such information is useful for debugging, transformations, auditing, evaluating the  quality  of  and  trust  in  data,  modelling  authenticity  and  implementing  access  control  for  derived  data.   7.1.4  CSC:big data service user (CSC:BDSU)   CSC:big data service user (CSC:BDSU) is the sub-role of the CSC performed by end-users or other  systems in order to use the services from the CSP:BDAP and CSP:BDIP.   Types of CSC:BDSU activities include:      use big data service;   7.1.4.1  Use big data service   The use big data service involves using the services of a CSP:BDAP  and a CSP:BDIP in order to  accomplish tasks.   Use big data service activity typically involves:  -   provision  of  user  credentials  to  enable  the  CSP:BDAP  and  CSP:BDIP  to  authenticate  the  user and grant access to the big data service;   -   invocation of the big data service.   7.2   Benefits of cloud computing based big data   One  of  the  main  purposes  of  big  data  is  to  extract  deep  information  from  large  volumes  of  data.  Large volumes of data can be analysed using two key methods; the scale-up method and the scale- out  method.  The  scale-up  method  uses  a  large  system  with  enough  resources  to  analyse  a  huge  amount of data. In contrast, the scale-out method uses many separate processing nodes, where each   10   Rec. ITU-T Y.3600 (11/2015)       processing  node  analyses  a  portion  of  data.  The  scale-out  method  has  the  ability  to  scale  just  by  adding  more  processing  nodes.  Cloud  computing  can  provide  big  data  with  cost-effective  elastic  processing, storage and network resources.   The key benefits of cloud computing based big data are:                  Scalability. Big data needs to have capabilities to store and process large volumes of data.  Therefore,  scalability  is  very  important  for  big  data.  However,  the  additional  systems  for  big data require a lot of time and cost management. Cloud computing can provide flexible  scalabilities to big data without additional expansion of infrastructure. It allows the big data  service user to easily upscale or downscale the resources quickly.   Resiliency.  Cloud  computing  can  support  big  data  to  have  resiliency  capabilities  to  maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faults affecting normal operation.   Cost effectiveness. Big data facilitates fast and scalable data processing such as system log  analysis  and  click  streams  analysis.  For  many  systems  and  platforms,  there  are  huge  volumes  of  log  data  and  traditionally  databases  are  used  to  perform  log  analysis.  But  the  cost  to  perform  data  analysis  (including  costs  of  storage,  system  maintenance,  etc.)  is  too  high  when  traditional  mechanisms  are  used.  Cloud  computing  can  offer  flexible  and  scalable resources in a cost effective manner.   Efficient  analysis.  In  order  to  extract  more  valuable  insights,  big  data  applications  and  services  need  a  well-defined  analytic  strategy  as  well  as  processing  power.  The  cloud  computing based big data service may dynamically use the required resources.   Deep  information  extraction.  Big  data  develops  new  business  insights  and  mechanisms  including  prediction  and  decision  assistance.  This  is  different  from  conventional  systems  because the data processing logic to handle the raw data and what kind of information can  be extracted from datasets is already known.    8   Requirements of cloud computing based big data   8.1   Data collection requirements   The data collection requirements include:   1)   2)   3)      4)      5)   6)   It  is  required  for  the  CSP:BDIP  to  support  collecting  data  from  multiple  CSN:DPs  in  parallel;   It  is  recommended  for  the  CSN:DP  to  expose  data  to  the  CSP:BDAP  by  publishing  metadata;   It  is  recommended  that  the  CSP:BDIP  supports  collecting  data  from  different  CSN:DPs  with different modes;   NOTE  Data could be collected in different modes, such as pull mode in which the data collection  process is initiated by CSP:BDIP, or push mode in which the data collection process is initiated by  the CSN:DP.

Table I.1  Personalization customized service using big data   Title   Personalization customized service using big data   Description   There are lots of network devices such as laptop computers, smart phones, smart  pads, PDAs, health equipment, etc. Owners of these devices can access Internet and  support network services in order to get some information, to buy something, to see  movies, etc. Each activity might be logged such as network access information,  records of visiting a website as well as usage of a service category in network service  providers. This data volume can be of a tremendous size due to so many devices  accessing Internet at same time. Consequently, data processing can become a big data  problem. More meaningful information can however be extracted from big data.  In this scenario, the CSP:BDIP should have capabilities to collect data and store said  data, and the CSP:BDAP should have capabilities to analyse data which are related to  the web service user's activities. The CSP:BDAP also has the task of providing the  results of analysis to the CSC:BDSU.  CSP:BDIP can store relevant information of the web service user's activities in the big  data storage and provides this data to the CSP:BDAP. The CSP:BDAP can receive  requests for operations with data and get some other information (e.g., weather  information, season, holiday information, etc.) from external data sources which are  supported by the CSN:DP.   The CSP:BDAP may know the patterns or preferences of the user through analysis of  the user's activities and pre-stored information.

Telecom mobile network users use 3G/4G  networks to access mobile internet services using mobile devices such as mobile phones  and tablet computers .The access network devices, such as PDSN or combined GPRS  service node (SGSN/CGSN) devices, record all kinds of billing information of each of  the mobile network users into a standardized format, such as a charging detail record  (CDR). A charging gateway function (CGF) modular collects different charging records  and forwards these charging records to the billing system. The billing system keeps and  processes all the CDRs from different CGFs and finally generates the charging bill for  each mobile user. Telecom operators set up big data infrastructure and store huge  amounts of user billing detail information.  Mobile network users could quickly query the detailed billing information based on the  big data infrastructure and big data applications. A mobile network user could get the  statistics and analytics information for instance in terms of time, type of website and  applications accessed through a 3G/4G mobile network for his/her internet access  actions through 3G/4G mobile networks..

Table II.1  Continuous product improvement   Title   Continuous product improvement   Description   A software game manufacturing company would like to concentrate on application  development as a basic activity and the area of investment. In order to continuously  improve its products, the company needs an analytics solution to collect and analyse  the associated market and users' feedback. The company embedded monitoring  functions in the software games to observe users' behaviours, activities and  preferences of available game options. In addition a questionnaire is included in the  game application for obtaining offline users' feedback. Other sources of information  about the game perception are Internet forums, discussion lists and social  communities, as well as press and television publications. Given the large number of  game users, the company has a lot of information to sift through every month. But  the amount of data can change depending on the schedule of new games publication,  so proper planning and smart organization of feedback data analysis would help the  company's IT team in their use of big data analytics to improve business success.   The game company builds an analytical solution based on big data as a service  (BDaaS) by defining:    the schedule of BDaaS activity depending on games publication time;    requirements for data collection directly from the application using embedded   monitoring functions;     requirements for collection of Internet and press data related to the game in order   to analyse users' and market opinions and its evolution;     requirements for social media data analysis of game users' opinions and direct   exchange between users;     the access method to the user generated questionnaire data about the game;    database selection for all data collected about the game;    requirements for analytics and reporting to emphasize the opinions about the   application, identify strong and weak points, gaps and spare elements;     monitoring criteria to analyse the intensity of new opinions on appearance  generated by users to identify the application maturity level, which allows  decisions to be made about ending involvement in the product;     performance objectives to be reached by the BDaaS system.  The game company orders a BDaaS including the following elements:    specification of data sources, which need to be serviced;    data integration goals for overall analytics;    database functionalities;    data storage functionalities (data types, variety, lifetime);    analytical tool functionalities;    access to analytical tool configuration and customization;    reporting schemes and integration with the company internal systems;    data collected and results of analysis available only for the company, even if   publicly available data are used.   26   Rec. ITU-T Y.3600 (11/2015)       Table II.1  Continuous product improvement   Roles/sub-roles     The cloud service provider should support the CSP:BDIP role to collect, process,   store and delete data according to the CSC (i.e., the game manufacturing  company) specifications. In addition, the CSP should support the CSP:BDAP  role to provide analytical applications with integration of CSC systems, as well  as reporting solutions.   Figure      Pre-conditions  (optional)   Post-conditions  (optional)   Derived  requirements      Title   Description   The game company has to plan the analytical solution to support application  development. The solution utilization can vary depending on the new products being  launched, so the investment in a solution may prove to be ineffective.   The game company can define analytical campaigns for each product and optimize  the analysis effectiveness. Only currently required capabilities are used from the  BDaaS solution in a pay-as-you-go model.

The virtual distributed cluster service uses distributed clustering software as a  framework, to distribute the customers' data and processing across a resizable  cluster of virtual machine instances in cloud resource pools. Three steps that are  often included by the CSC using a virtual cluster service are:  1)  Upload data. The CSC:BDSU uploads the data that needs to be analysed to   the cloud storage space that belongs to the CSC:BDSU. In addition the  CSC:BDSU could use the data provided by the CSN:DP.         Rec. ITU-T Y.3600 (11/2015)   27       Table II.2  Virtualized distributed cluster service   2)  Create virtual distributed cluster. The CSC:BDSU creates and configures   the distributed cluster by specifying data inputs, outputs, cluster size, security  settings and other necessary parameters.   3)  Monitor and collect. CSC:BDSU monitors the health and progress of the   distributed cluster using the tools provided by the CSP. When the distributed  processing job is completed the CSC:BDSU retrieves the output in the  specified storage space.   A virtual distributed cluster service could be used in a variety of applications,  including log analysis, web indexing, data warehousing, machine learning,  financial analysis, scientific simulation and bioinformatics.

Table  III.1  shows  the  results  of  mapping  between  the  sub-role  of  the  cloud  computing  reference  architecture (CCRA) user view and  the performance of  similar roles in  the  big data ecosystem. A  similar  sub-role  with  a  data  supplier  does  not  exist  in  CCRA.  A  big  data  service  customer  and  a  CSC  may  be  considered  to  perform  similar  activities.  Similarly,  a  data  broker  and  CSN:  cloud  service broker may be considered in the same manner. If the CCRA is assumed to contain the big  data  service  area,  the  activities  for  the  CSN:  cloud  service  broker  should  be  extended  in  the  data  perspective. The big data service provider is related to all sub-roles of the CSP. This means that the  big data service provider could be treated with an implanted feature or an independent sub-role of  the CSP.

The big data service provider could be treated with an  implemented feature.   Nevertheless, to clarify the cloud-based big data service, an  independent sub-role of the CSP for the big data service  provider is required.       Rec.
