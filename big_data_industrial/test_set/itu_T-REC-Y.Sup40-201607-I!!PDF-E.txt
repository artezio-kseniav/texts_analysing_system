Y series  Supplement 40 (07/2016)   i       FOREWORD   The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is  the United Nations specialized agency in the field of  telecommunications,  information  and  communication  technologies  (ICTs).  The  ITU  Telecommunication  Standardization  Sector  (ITU-T)  is  a  permanent  organ  of  ITU.  ITU-T  is  responsible  for  studying  technical,  operating  and  tariff  questions  and  issuing  Recommendations  on  them  with  a  view  to  standardizing  telecommunications on a worldwide basis.   The World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA), which meets every four years, establishes  the topics for study by the ITU-T study groups which, in turn, produce Recommendations on these topics.   The approval of ITU-T Recommendations is covered by the procedure laid down in WTSA Resolution 1.   In  some  areas  of  information  technology  which  fall  within  ITU-T's  purview,  the  necessary  standards  are  prepared on a collaborative basis with ISO and IEC.

With  the  rapid  development  of  information  and  communications  technology  (ICT),  Internet  technologies and services, huge amount of data are generated, transmitted and stored with explosive  growth. Data are generated by many sources and not only sensors, cameras, network devices, web  pages, email systems, social networks and many other sources. Datasets are becoming so large and   2   Y series  Supplement 40 (07/2016)       complex  or  are  arriving  so  fast  that  traditional  data  processing  methods  and  tools  are  inadequate.  Efficient  analytics  of  data  within  tolerable  elapsed  times  becomes  very  challenging.  The  paradigm  being developed to resolve the above issues are called big data [ITU-T Y.3600].   Within  big  data  ecosystem,  data  types  include  structured,  semi-structured  and  unstructured  data.  Structured data are often stored in databases which may be organized in different  models, such as  relational model, document model, key-value model, graph model etc. Semi-structured data does not  conform  to  the  formal  structure  of  data  models,  but  contain  tags  or  markers  to  identify  data.  Unstructured data do not have a pre-defined data model and are not organized in any defined manner.  Within all data types data can exist in formats, such as text, spreadsheet, video, audio, image, map,  etc. [ITU-T Y.3600].   Big data is used in many fields, where data processing is characterized by scale (volume), diversity  (variety),  speed  (velocity)  and  possibly  others  like  credibility  (veracity)  or  business  value,  if  traditional  methods  and  tools  are  not  efficient.  These  characteristics,  usually  called  v's,  can  be  explained as following [ITU-T Y.3600]:            Volume: refers to the amount of data collected, stored, analyzed and visualized, which big  data technologies need to resolve;   Variety:  refers  to  different  data  types  and  data  formats  that  are  processed  by  big  data  technologies;   Velocity: refers to both how fast the data is collected and how fast the data is processed by  big data technologies to deliver expected results.   NOTE  Additionally, veracity refers to the uncertainty of data, and value refers to the business results from  gaining new information using big data technologies. Other v's can be considered as well.   Taking into account the described above v's characteristics, big data technologies and services can  resolve  many  new  challenges,  and  can  also  create  more  new  opportunities  than  ever  before  [ITU-T Y.3600]:               Heterogeneity and incompleteness: data processed using big data can miss some attributes  or introduce noise into data transmission. Even after data cleaning and error correction, some  incompleteness  and  some  errors  in  data  are  likely  to  remain.  These  challenges  can  be  managed during data analysis [b-CRA].   Scale: processing of large and rapidly increasing volumes of data is a challenging task. Using  data processing technologies, the data scale challenge is mitigated by evolution of processing  and storage resources. However, nowadays data volumes are scaling faster than resources are  evolving. Technologies such as parallel databases, in-memory databases, non-SQL databases  and analytical algorithms resolve this challenge.   Timeliness: the acquisition rate and timeliness, to effectively find elements in a limited-time  period  that  meet  a  specified  criterion  in  a  large  dataset,  are  new  challenges  faced  by  data  processing. Other new challenges are related to the types of criteria specified, and need to  devise new index structures and responses to the queries having tight response-time limits.   Privacy: data about human individuals, such as: demographic information, Internet activities,  commutation patterns, social interactions, energy or water consumption, are being collected  and  analyzed  for  different  purposes.  Big  data  technologies  and  services  are  challenged  to  protect  personal  identities  and  sensitive  attributes  of  data  throughout  the  entire  data  processing process, while respecting applicable data retention policies.   Positive  resolution  of  the  above  challenges  opens  new  opportunities  to  discover  new  data  relationships, hidden patterns or unknown dependencies [ITU-T Y.3600].         Y series  Supplement 40 (07/2016)   3       6.2   Benefits of big data   Big data technologies can provide many benefits such as data accessibility, productivity of business  processes, and cost reduction to private via public sector.   Big data technology increases data accessibility by:            Unlocking significant value by making information transparent;   Creating and storing transactional data in digital form;   Reducing time for finding/accessing the correct data.   Big data technology improves productivity by:               Real-time monitoring and forecasting of events that impact either business performance or  operations;   Timely insights from the vast amount of data;   Identifying significant information that can improve decision quality or minimize risks;   Creating new service models using big data analytics.   Big data technology reduces cost by:         7   Scale-out of data storage;   Identifying and reducing inefficiencies.   Related technical areas of big data   7.1   Cloud computing   Cloud computing is a paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable  physical  or  virtual  resources  with  self-service  provisioning  and  administration  on-demand.  Key  characteristics of cloud computing are [ITU-T Y.3500]:                     Broad network access: a feature where physical and virtual resources are available over a  network  and  accessed  through  standard  mechanisms  that  promote  use  by  heterogeneous  client platforms;   Measured service: a feature where the metered delivery of cloud services is such that usage  can  be  monitored,  controlled,  reported,  and  billed.  This  is  an  important  feature  needed  to  optimize and validate the delivered cloud service;   Multi-tenancy: a feature where physical or virtual resources are allocated in such a way that  multiple tenants and their computations and data are isolated from, and inaccessible to, one  another;   On-demand self-service: a feature where a cloud service customer can provision computing  capabilities,  as  needed,  automatically  or  with  minimal  interaction  with  the  cloud  service  provider;   Rapid elasticity and scalability: a feature where physical or virtual resources can be rapidly  and  elastically  adjusted,  in  some  cases  automatically,  to  quickly  increase  or  decrease  resources;   Resource pooling: a feature where a cloud service provider's physical or virtual resources  can be aggregated in order to serve one or more cloud service customers.   Big  data  needs  on-demand  high-performance  data  processing  and  distributed  storage  as  well  as  a  variety  of  tools  required  to  accomplish  activities  of  the  big  data  ecosystem.  The  burst  nature  of  workloads makes cloud computing more appropriate for big data challenges such as scalability and  timeliness [ITU-T Y.3600].   The relationship of cloud computing and big data mainly concerns two aspects:   4   Y series  Supplement 40 (07/2016)       1)   2)   Cloud computing can support big data using cloud infrastructure and services;   Big data services can provide public cloud analysis services, such as  big data as a service  (BDaaS).   7.2   Internet of things   The Internet of things (IoT) is a global infrastructure for the information society, enabling advanced  services by interconnecting (physical and virtual) things based on existing and evolving interoperable  information and communication technologies [ITU-T Y.2060].   The IoT can be perceived as a far-reaching vision with technological and societal implications. From  the perspective of technical standardization, the IoT can be viewed as a global infrastructure for the  information  society,  enabling  advanced  services  by  interconnecting  (physical  and  virtual)  things  based on  existing and evolving interoperable  ICT. Through the exploitation of identification, data  capture,  processing  and  communication  capabilities,  the  IoT  makes  full  use  of  "things"  to  offer  services  to  all  kinds  of  applications,  while  ensuring  that  security  and  privacy  requirements  are  fulfilled.   Big data in the context of IoT has some specific characteristics which do not necessarily pertain to  big data in other technical areas. The prominent characteristics of big data in the context of IoT are:  high  variety  (heterogeneity  of  data  types  and  sources),  high  velocity  (high  frequency  of  data  generation) and high volatility (data generated in a non-persistent stateless manner).   Some identified challenges concerning big data in the context of IoT are the following [b-Chen]:               An increasing number of connected things generates huge amounts of data;   The generated data are mainly semi-structured or even unstructured;   The generated data may have different confidence and precision levels;   The generated data are generally not useful until they are adequately "processed" (including  pre-processing, analysis, etc.).   7.3   Security and privacy   Data security and privacy comprise the people, process and technology required to prevent destructive  forces and unwanted actions [b-IBM]. From a big data perspective, security and privacy requirements  are magnified by the characteristics of big data. Some identified challenges concerning big data in  the context of security and privacy are the following [b-CSA]:                     Secure computations in distributed programing frameworks;   Secure data storage and transactions logs;   End-point input validation/filtering and data provenance;   Real-time security/compliance monitoring;   Scalable and composable privacy-preserving data mining and analytics;   Anonymization and de-identification.   7.4   Software-defined networking   Software-defined  networking  (SDN)  is  a  set  of  techniques  that  enables  users  to  directly  program,  orchestrate,  control  and  manage  network  resources,  which  facilitates  the  design,  delivery  and  operation of network services in a dynamic and scalable manner [ITU-T Y.3300]. By abstracting the  underlying infrastructure for applications and network services, SDN lets administrators dynamically  adjust  network-wide  traffic  flow  to  meet  changing  needs,  while  maintaining  a  global  view  of  the  network.         Y series  Supplement 40 (07/2016)   5       Big data processing requires agile, multi-domain, centrally managed architecture. SDN addresses the  congestion and lack of scalability of current networks by [b-NEC]:            Allowing for changing traffic patterns;   Providing functionality to applications that access geographically distributed databases and  servers through public and private clouds;   Providing access to bandwidth on demand.   7.5   Deep packet inspection   Deep  packet  inspection  (DPI)  is  a  form  of  filtering  used  to  inspect  data  packets  sent  from  one  computer  to  another  over  a  network.  Software-based  DPI,  provides  advanced  traffic  analysis  and  multidimensional reporting, showing the possibility of making off-the-shelf hardware work at actual  line rates. Software-based DPI can be pervasively deployed in the network, providing much better  analysis capabilities, as well as simpler mechanisms for deployment, update, testing and scaling to  changing workloads [b-ITU-T DPI].   7.6   Big data-driven networking   Big  data-driven  networking  (bDDN)  is  a  group  of  technologies  and  methods  to  facilitate  network  operation, administration, maintenance and optimization, etc., based on the big data generated by the  network and a series of methods and tools. That is to say, big data generated by the network is used  to  serve the network and make the network  better. bDDN solves this problem by introducing and  applying the big data technology to the framework of future networks [b-ITU-T DDN].   7.7   Open data   Open data is accessible public data that people, companies, and organizations can use to launch new  ventures, analyze patterns and trends, make data-driven decisions, and solve complex problems. Open  data includes two basic features: the data must be publicly available for anyone to use, and it must be  licensed in a way that allows for its reuse [b-theguardian]. Open data is more focused on a horizontal  scaling of big data sources.   The main technical issues for open data are as follows:            Data publication: metadata supporting machine readability, data format, and licenses;   Data finding: data identification, data semantics, and data access;   Data provenance: data quality, data lineage tracking, and data versioning.   7.8   Standardization areas of big data   This  clause  describes  the  potential  areas  of  standardization  for  big  data  that  may  be  of  interest  to  ITU-T [b-ITU-T TSAG]:                           Common requirements and use cases;   Definition, architecture, data model and application program interfaces (APIs);   Network-driven data analytics;   Personalized network experience;   Security and data protection, anonymization and de-identification of personal data;   Framework for data quality and veracity;   Standards and guidelines to address issues surrounding legal implications of big data in the  telecommunications sector (e.g., data ownership);   Framework and related standards for telecom big data exchange.   6   Y series  Supplement 40 (07/2016)       8   Conceptual model of big data ecosystem   [ITU-T Y.3600] describes the roles and sub-roles of the big data ecosystem as shown in Figure 8-1.   Figure 8-1  Big data ecosystem (from [ITU-T Y.3600])      Data provider (DP) roles consists of two sub-roles:         data supplier;   data broker.   The data supplier provides data from different sources to the data broker, which can be accessed by  the big data service provider (BDSP). The data supplier's activities include:            generate data;   create metadata information describing the data source(s) and relevant attributes;   publish metadata information to access it.   The data broker serves as the connection between the data supplier and the BDSP. The data broker  can act as a clearinghouse, open data mart, etc., and its activities include:            providing a meta-information registry to data suppliers for publishing their data sources;   finding on-line open-data sources and registering corresponding meta-information;   providing a service catalogue to the BDSP for searching usable data.   The BDSP supports capabilities for big data analytics and infrastructure. The BDSP can act as a form  of big data platform, extension of existing data analytics platform, etc. BDSP activities include:                  searching data sources (from data broker) and collecting data by requesting and crawling;   storing data to a data repository;   integrating data;   providing tools for data analysis and visualization;   supporting  data  management  such  as:  data  provenance,  data  privacy,  data  security,  data  retention policy, data ownership.   The big data service customer (BDC) is the end-user or a system, that uses the results or services  from a BDSP. The BDC may produce new services or knowledge on consumer activities and furnish  them outside of the big data ecosystem. BDC activities include:         requesting big data services to the BDSP;   using the outputs of big data services.         Y series  Supplement 40 (07/2016)   7       9   Big data SDO activities   This  clause  describes  SDO's  activities  with  big  data  in  order  to  identify  the  current  status  of  standardization.   NOTE  A summary of each standard item is described in Appendix I.   9.1   ITU-T   ITU-T  Study  Group  13  (SG13)  has  been  studying  requirements,  capabilities  and  mechanisms  of  future networks.            Q17/13 deals with cloud computing and big data. In November 2015, ITU-T SG13 published  [ITU-T Y.3600], "Big data  Cloud computing based requirements and capabilities".   Q18/13  deals  with  cloud  functional  architecture,  infrastructure  and  networking;  the  draft  Recommendation [ITU-T Y.BDaaS-arch] describes an architecture for BDaaS.   Q7/13  has  been  studying  DPI  in  support  of  service/application  awareness  in  evolving  networks, and initiated draft Recommendations about DPI and bDDN for supporting big data.   ITU-T SG 17 is responsible for building confidence and security in the use of ICTs, and deals with  the  security  and  privacy  issues  of  cloud  computing.  These  activities  on  cloud  computing  can  be  applied to the area of big data as well.   (SC&C).

Status   Published   2015   10   Gap analysis in big data standardization   This clause provides a matrix for gap analysis and the related standardization activities with big data  in order to identify standardization gaps.   The matrix is composed of two axes. The horizontal axis describes document categories which cover  the subject of applications as follows:         General,  definition:  the  standard  which  provides  general  descriptions  or  terms  and  definitions of the technology;   Common  requirements,  use  cases:  the  standard  which  provides  use  cases  and  derived  general/functional requirements;   12   Y series  Supplement 40 (07/2016)                   Architecture: the standard which provides reference architecture;   API,  interface,  profile:  the  standard  which  provides  common  interface,  API  and/or  its  profile;   Data model, format, schema: the standard which provides data model or protocol including  scheme and/or its encoding format;   Others (e.g., guidelines, technical reports).   The vertical axis describes the related technologies for supporting big data as follows.                        Fundamental: concept of big data and its applications;   Data exchange: for supporting big data publishing, sharing, transaction, etc.;   Data integration: with heterogeneous data sources;   Analysis/visualization: for mining model description, etc.;   Data provenance/metadata: for data quality, history tracking, data management, etc.;   Security/privacy: for big data, especially personal identification information;   Other: big data related technologies which are not described above.   NOTE 1  The items on the horizontal axis are not subordinated to the different technologies.   NOTE 2  The items on the vertical axis can be modified with technology change.   NOTE 3  A standard has more than one location on the matrix. In the case that one standard is included in  multiple document categories (horizontal axis) or related technologies (vertical axis), it can be mapped several  times.

This document defines the  schema and provides examples for its use.   By  using  DCAT  to  describe  datasets  in  data  catalogs,  publishers  increase  discoverability  and  enable  applications  easily  to  consume  metadata  from  multiple  catalogs.  It  further  enables  decentralized   Y series  Supplement 40 (07/2016)   19       publishing  of  catalogs  and  facilitates  federated  dataset  search  across  sites.  Aggregated  DCAT  metadata  can  serve  as  a  manifest  file  to  facilitate digital preservation.
