In a nationwide prospective cohort study of more than 1 million women living in Denmark, an increased risk for first use of an antidepressant and first diagnosis of depression was found among users of different types of hormonal contraception, with the highest rates among adolescents.
To investigate whether the use of hormonal contraception is positively associated with subsequent use of antidepressants and a diagnosis of depression at a psychiatric hospital.
All women and adolescents aged 15 to 34 years who were living in Denmark were followed up from January 1, 2000, to December 2013, if they had no prior depression diagnosis, redeemed prescription for antidepressants, other major psychiatric diagnosis, cancer, venous thrombosis, or infertility treatment.
Adolescents (age range, 15-19 years) using combined oral contraceptives had an RR of a first use of an antidepressant of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.75-1.84) and those using progestin-only pills, 2.2 (95% CI, 1.99-2.52).


 ******* The name of the file is "Behavioral Interventions for Antipsychotic Medication Associated Obesity.txt" ******* 
Behavioral Interventions for Antipsychotic MedicationAssociated Obesity: A Randomized, Controlled Clinical Trial.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of a Diabetes Prevention Programinspired 12-month behavioral intervention for patients with severe mental illness (SMI) and medication-associated obesity.
122 outpatients with DSM-IVdiagnosed SMI taking antipsychotic medications who had  7% weight gain or body mass index (BMI) > 25 were randomized by computer-generated number to Lifestyle Balance treatment intervention (n = 60) or usual care control (n = 62) groups.
Our intention-to-treat analysis found significant differences in predicted trajectory of mean weight change between the groups over 12 months (P < .01), with treatment participants expected to lose an average 4.6 kg, while control participants would gain an average 0.6 kg.
Treatment was more effective than usual care control in treating medication-associated obesity, independent of SMI diagnosis, antipsychotic medication, and knowledge gained, suggesting that behavioral interventions are effective in SMI patients.


 ******* The name of the file is "Care for Adolescents with Depression in Primary Care Settings.txt" ******* 
The Reaching Out to Adolescents in Distress (ROAD) collaborative care model has been found to be effective in treating adolescent major depressive disorder, but is it cost-effective?
A randomized clinical trial conducted at 9 primary care clinics in Washington State suggests that collaborative care results in an increase of 0.04 quality-adjusted life-year over usual care at USD 883 above usual care, for a mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of USD 18239 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.
This randomized clinical trial was conducted between April 1, 2010, and April 30, 2013, at 9 primary care clinics in the Group Health system in Washington State.
The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $18239 (95% CI, dominant to $24408) per QALY gained, with dominant indicating that the intervention resulted in both a net cost savings and a net increase in QALYs. Collaborative care for adolescent depression appears to be cost-effective, with 95% CIs far below the strictest willingness-to-pay thresholds.


 ******* The name of the file is "Cigarette Smoking and the Onset and Persistence of Panic Attacks During Mid-Adulthood in the United States.txt" ******* 
Cigarette Smoking and the Onset and Persistence of Panic Attacks During Mid-Adulthood in the United States: 19942005.
The current study examined the relationship between cigarette smoking (daily) and risk of onset and persistence of panic attacks over a 10-year period among adults in mid-adulthood in the United States and whether quitting smoking reduced the risk for panic attacks.
Daily smoking in 1994 (OR = 1.9 [95% CI, 1.13.3]) and persistent daily smoking in 1994 and 2005 (OR = 2.6 [95% CI, 1.44.8]) were associated with a significantly increased likelihood of panic attacks in 2005.
Moreover, smoking abstinence significantly reduced the risk of new-onset panic attacks (OR = 0.6 [95% CI, 0.40.97]) and persistence of panic attacks (OR = 0.2 [95% CI, 0.10.5]).
The present data provide novel evidence that smoking is associated with an increased risk of panic attacks and that quitting smoking helps reduce such risk.


 ******* The name of the file is "Efficacy of Topiramate in the Treatment of Crack Cocaine Dependence.txt" ******* 
Efficacy of Topiramate in the Treatment of Crack Cocaine Dependence: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial.
We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of topiramate in the treatment of crack cocaine dependence.
The primary outcome measures were detection of benzoylecgonine in the urine, study retention, frequency of cocaine smoking, amount of cocaine use, and mean amount of money spent on cocaine per week.
Topiramate reduced the quantity of cocaine used (mean reduction = 3.108 g, P < .001), the frequency of cocaine use (mean = 0.784 times per week, P = .005), and the amount of money spent on cocaine (mean [US dollars] = $25.38, P = .015; this variable did not achieve statistical significance after Bonferroni correction) compared with the placebo during the 12 weeks (or 84 days) of the assessment.


 ******* The name of the file is "Efficacy, Acceptability, and Tolerability of Antipsychotics in Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia.txt" ******* 
To integrate all the randomized evidence from the available antipsychotics used for treatment-resistant schizophrenia by performing a network meta-analysis.
At least 2 independent reviewers selected published and unpublished single- and double-blind RCTs in treatment-resistant schizophrenia (any study-defined criterion) that compared any antipsychotic (at any dose and in any form of administration) with another antipsychotic or placebo.
In the primary outcome (reported as standardized mean difference; 95% credible interval), olanzapine was more effective than quetiapine (0.29; 0.56 to 0.02), haloperidol (0.
A pattern of superiority for olanzapine, clozapine, and risperidone was seen in other efficacy outcomes, but results were not consistent and effect sizes were usually small.
In addition, relatively few RCTs were available for antipsychotics other than clozapine, haloperidol, olanzapine, and risperidone.
Insufficient evidence exists on which antipsychotic is more efficacious for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and blinded RCTsin contrast to unblinded, randomized effectiveness studiesprovide little evidence of the superiority of clozapine compared with other second-generation antipsychotics.


 ******* The name of the file is "Exaggerated Acquisition and Resistance to Extinction of Avoidance Behavior in Treated Heroin-Dependent Men.txt" ******* 
In rodents, opioid intake has been associated with abnormal acquisition and extinction of avoidance behavior.
Adults meeting DSM-IV criteria for heroin dependence and treated with opioid medication (n = 27) and healthy controls (n = 26) were recruited between March 2013 and October 2013 and given a computer-based task to assess avoidance behavior.
While groups did not differ on escape responding (hiding) during the aversive event, heroin-dependent men (but not women) made more avoidance responses during a warning signal that predicted the aversive event (analysis of variance, sex  group interaction, P = .007).
Heroin-dependent men were also slower to extinguish the avoidance response when the aversive event no longer followed the warning signal (P = .011).
Results suggest that, in male patients, differences in avoidance behavior cannot be easily explained by impaired task performance or by exaggerated motor activity.
This study provides evidence for abnormal acquisition and extinction of avoidance behavior in opioid-dependent patients.


 ******* The name of the file is "Short-term Suicide Risk After Psychiatric Hospital Discharge.txt" ******* 
In this national retrospective longitudinal cohort of almost 1.9 million adult inpatients in the Medicaid program, suicide risk during the first 90 days after hospital discharge was highest for patients with first-listed depressive disorders, followed by those with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders and lowest for patients with nonmental disorders.
To describe the risk for suicide during the 90 days after hospital discharge for adults with first-listed diagnoses of depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, and other mental disorders in relation to inpatients with diagnoses of nonmental disorders and the general population.
This national retrospective longitudinal cohort included inpatients aged 18 to 64 years in the Medicaid program who were discharged with a first-listed diagnosis of a mental disorder (depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, and other mental disorder) and a 10% random sample of inpatients with diagnoses of nonmental disorders.


 ******* The name of the file is "Treatment Preferences of Psychotherapy Patients with Chronic PTSD.txt" ******* 
Treatment Preferences of Psychotherapy Patients With Chronic PTSD.
Patient treatment preference may moderate treatment effect in major depressive disorder (MDD) studies.
Little research has addressed preference in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); almost none has assessed actual patients PTSD psychotherapy preferences.
From a 14-week trial of chronic PTSD comparing prolonged exposure, relaxation therapy, and interpersonal psychotherapy, we report treatment preferences of the 110 randomized patients, explore preference correlates, and assess effects on treatment outcome.
Patients recruited between 2008 and 2013 with chronic DSM-IV PTSD (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale [CAPS] score  50) received balanced, scripted psychotherapy descriptions prerandomization and indicated their preferences.
We hypothesized that patients randomized to preferred treatments would have better outcomes, and to unwanted treatment worse outcomes.
Comorbidly depressed patients receiving unwanted treatment had worse final CAPS scores.
Preference subtly affected psychotherapy outcome; depression appeared an important moderator of the effect of unwanted treatment on outcome.


 ******* The name of the file is "Use of Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) During Pregnancy .txt" ******* 
Use of Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) During Pregnancy and the Risk of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in the Offspring.
Several small and large prospective studies have found an association between gestational acetaminophen exposure and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behaviors, use of ADHD medication, and ADHD diagnoses in offspring during childhood; the only negative study was a small investigation that examined only one aspect of attention as an outcome.
In the light of the finding of a single study that infection and fever during pregnancy by themselves do not raise the ADHD risk, it appears possible that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy is itself responsible for the increased risk of ADHD.
However, since fever during pregnancy may itself be associated with adverse gestational outcomes, given the present level of uncertainty about the ADHD risk with acetaminophen, it is suggested that, until more data are available, the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy should not be denied in situations in which the need for the drug is clear.
