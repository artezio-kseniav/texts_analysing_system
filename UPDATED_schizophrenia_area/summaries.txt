We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of topiramate in the treatment of crack cocaine dependence.The subjects were randomly assigned to either a topiramate group (subjects received 50–200 mg of topiramate per day for 12 weeks) or a control group (subjects received placebo).The primary outcome measures were detection of benzoylecgonine in the urine, study retention, frequency of cocaine smoking, amount of cocaine use, and mean amount of money spent on cocaine per week.Twenty-nine subjects in the topiramate group and 29 subjects in the control group completed the study.Negative results from a urine test for benzoylecgonine (a cocaine metabolite), which is a measure of cocaine abstinence, were more frequently obtained from the topiramate group (OR = 8.687, P < .001).Topiramate reduced the quantity of cocaine used (mean reduction = −3.108 g, P < .001), the frequency of cocaine use (mean = −0.784 times per week, P = .005), and the amount of money spent on cocaine (mean [US dollars] = −$25.38, P = .015; this variable did not achieve statistical significance after Bonferroni correction) compared with the placebo during the 12 weeks (or 84 days) of the assessment.However, the differences in reductions between the 2 groups in the quantity of cocaine used, the frequency of cocaine use, and money spent on cocaine over time (time × group interaction) were present only during the first 4 weeks, and none of these variables by 12 weeks.The present findings indicate that topiramate is effective and safe and thus reinforce previous data suggesting that topiramate is a potentially useful treatment for crack cocaine dependence.

Efficacy of Topiramate in the Treatment of Crack Cocaine Dependence: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial.We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of topiramate in the treatment of crack cocaine dependence.The initial daily treatment dose was 50 mg, and this dose was increased weekly at increments of 25 to 50 mg, based on the subject’s tolerability, to a maximum of 200 mg. All of the subjects also participated in motivational interviews and group therapy.Longitudinal assessment revealed that retention was not significant (odds ratio [OR] = 1.072, P = .908) between the 2 groups.Negative results from a urine test for benzoylecgonine (a cocaine metabolite), which is a measure of cocaine abstinence, were more frequently obtained from the topiramate group (OR = 8.687, P < .001).Topiramate reduced the quantity of cocaine used (mean reduction = −3.108 g, P < .001), the frequency of cocaine use (mean = −0.784 times per week, P = .005), and the amount of money spent on cocaine (mean [US dollars] = −$25.38, P = .015; this variable did not achieve statistical significance after Bonferroni correction) compared with the placebo during the 12 weeks (or 84 days) of the assessment.The present findings indicate that topiramate is effective and safe and thus reinforce previous data suggesting that topiramate is a potentially useful treatment for crack cocaine dependence.Future studies with larger samples are needed to confirm these results.

Moreover, an increasing number of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of other antipsychotics have been published.To integrate all the randomized evidence from the available antipsychotics used for treatment-resistant schizophrenia by performing a network meta-analysis.At least 2 independent reviewers selected published and unpublished single- and double-blind RCTs in treatment-resistant schizophrenia (any study-defined criterion) that compared any antipsychotic (at any dose and in any form of administration) with another antipsychotic or placebo.At least 2 independent reviewers extracted all data into standard forms and assessed the quality of all included trials with the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk-of-bias tool.The primary outcome was efficacy as measured by overall change in symptoms of schizophrenia.In the primary outcome (reported as standardized mean difference; 95% credible interval), olanzapine was more effective than quetiapine (−0.29; −0.56 to −0.02), haloperidol (−0.29; −0.44 to −0.13), and sertindole (−0.46; −0.80 to −0.06); clozapine was more effective than haloperidol (−0.22; −0.38 to −0.07) and sertindole (−0.40; −0.74 to −0.04); and risperidone was more effective than sertindole (−0.32; −0.63 to −0.01).Insufficient evidence exists on which antipsychotic is more efficacious for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and blinded RCTs—in contrast to unblinded, randomized effectiveness studies—provide little evidence of the superiority of clozapine compared with other second-generation antipsychotics.

Exaggerated Acquisition and Resistance to Extinction of Avoidance Behavior in Treated Heroin-Dependent Men.In rodents, opioid intake has been associated with abnormal acquisition and extinction of avoidance behavior.Adults meeting DSM-IV criteria for heroin dependence and treated with opioid medication (n = 27) and healthy controls (n = 26) were recruited between March 2013 and October 2013 and given a computer-based task to assess avoidance behavior.For this task, subjects controlled a spaceship and could either gain points by shooting an enemy spaceship or hide in safe areas to avoid on-screen aversive events.Hiding duration during different periods of the task was used to measure avoidance behavior.While groups did not differ on escape responding (hiding) during the aversive event, heroin-dependent men (but not women) made more avoidance responses during a warning signal that predicted the aversive event (analysis of variance, sex × group interaction, P = .007).Results suggest that, in male patients, differences in avoidance behavior cannot be easily explained by impaired task performance or by exaggerated motor activity.This study provides evidence for abnormal acquisition and extinction of avoidance behavior in opioid-dependent patients.

Addiction is often conceptualized as a behavioral strategy for avoiding negative experiences.Here, we tested the hypothesis that these findings would generalize to human opioid-dependent subjects.For this task, subjects controlled a spaceship and could either gain points by shooting an enemy spaceship or hide in safe areas to avoid on-screen aversive events.While groups did not differ on escape responding (hiding) during the aversive event, heroin-dependent men (but not women) made more avoidance responses during a warning signal that predicted the aversive event (analysis of variance, sex × group interaction, P = .007).Heroin-dependent men were also slower to extinguish the avoidance response when the aversive event no longer followed the warning signal (P = .011).This behavioral pattern resulted in reduced opportunity to obtain reward without reducing risk of punishment.Interestingly, data suggest that abnormal avoidance is demonstrated only by male patients.Findings shed light on cognitive and behavioral manifestations of opioid addiction and may facilitate development of therapeutic approaches to help affected individuals.

Treatment Preferences of Psychotherapy Patients With Chronic PTSD.Patient treatment preference may moderate treatment effect in major depressive disorder (MDD) studies.Little research has addressed preference in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); almost none has assessed actual patients’ PTSD psychotherapy preferences.From a 14-week trial of chronic PTSD comparing prolonged exposure, relaxation therapy, and interpersonal psychotherapy, we report treatment preferences of the 110 randomized patients, explore preference correlates, and assess effects on treatment outcome.Patients recruited between 2008 and 2013 with chronic DSM-IV PTSD (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale [CAPS] score ≥ 50) received balanced, scripted psychotherapy descriptions prerandomization and indicated their preferences.We hypothesized that patients randomized to preferred treatments would have better outcomes, and to unwanted treatment worse outcomes.Eighty-seven patients (79%) voiced treatment preferences or disinclinations: 29 (26%) preferred prolonged exposure, 29 (26%) preferred relaxation therapy, and 56 (50%) preferred interpersonal psychotherapy (Cochran Q = 18.46, P < .001), whereas 29 (26%) were disinclined to prolonged exposure, 18 (16%) to relaxation therapy, and 3 (3%) to interpersonal psychotherapy (Cochran Q = 22.71, P < .001).Preference subtly affected psychotherapy outcome; depression appeared an important moderator of the effect of unwanted treatment on outcome.

Use of Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) During Pregnancy and the Risk of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in the Offspring.Prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may result in compromised neurodevelopment through inflammatory and immunologic mechanisms, through predisposition to oxidative stress, and through endocrine, endogenous cannabinoid, and other mechanisms.Several small and large prospective studies have found an association between gestational acetaminophen exposure and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behaviors, use of ADHD medication, and ADHD diagnoses in offspring during childhood; the only negative study was a small investigation that examined only one aspect of attention as an outcome.Creditably, most of the studies adjusted analyses for many (but not all) confounds associated with ADHD risk.Importantly, one pivotal study also adjusted for pain, infection, inflammation, and fever to reduce confounding by indication; this study found a dose-dependent risk.In the light of the finding of a single study that infection and fever during pregnancy by themselves do not raise the ADHD risk, it appears possible that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy is itself responsible for the increased risk of ADHD.This suggests that acetaminophen may not be as safe in pregnancy as is widely believed.However, since fever during pregnancy may itself be associated with adverse gestational outcomes, given the present level of uncertainty about the ADHD risk with acetaminophen, it is suggested that, until more data are available, the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy should not be denied in situations in which the need for the drug is clear.
